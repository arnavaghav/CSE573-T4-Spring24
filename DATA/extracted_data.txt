SW Asian #4 Heroin  



The Heroin we offer comes direct from the
importer with no middle man


It is white/light beige in
color and we take great pride in the fact that we do not cut
our product whatsoever and we ensure that our source does
not do so either! 

We would much prefer to
offer a high quality product and have repeat customers 



Whats
the difference between #3 and #4 heroin?



Most people know this but
we do get this asked often enough that we decided to add this
information onto the listing.



The most commonly found
forms of Heroin are #3 and #4


No.4 grade Heroin
is the PUREST form of Heroin. It is a white powder that is
easily dissolved in water and thus readily injected. 



No.3
grade Heroin
is a tan-coloured, granular product often referred to as Ëbrown
rock
The difference in color
between No.4 and No.3 grades is a result of impurities introduced
during or remaining after the manufacturing process. No.3 grade is
commonly heated and the vapors inhaled. It can be injected but it
has to be dissolved in citrus instead of water.



To
keep it simple, think about it like this;



 #4
Heroin
is water soluable and MUCH more pure and desireable
among IV users and people who sniff whereas, #3 is for people who
prefer to smoke it.



However, #4 Heroin
can be smoked as well (usually by adding cafeine or another
adulterant to make it burn slower)

Important information - Unlike cash, the value of investments, and any income from them, can fall as well as rise so you could get back less than you invest. Our service, which is not personal advice, is designed for investors who are happy making their own investment decisions. If you're unsure what's right for you, please seek advice. Tax rules can change and the value of any benefits depends on your personal circumstances.
The award-winning HL Stocks and Shares ISA offers something for every investor. Whether youâre new to investing or already an expert, you can shelter up to Â£20,000 from UK tax in our ISA.
Start investing today from just £100 or £25 per month. It’s easy to open an ISA and the annual charge for holding investments is never more than 0.45%, other charges apply.
Investing earlier gives you a better chance of reaching your goals sooner. The longer your money is invested, the more time it has to hopefully grow.

A Stocks and Shares ISA offers a simple and tax-efficient way to grow your money for the future.
                
Itâs not an investment in its own right, itâs a type of account.
And itâs special because when you buy investments within an ISA you shelter them from UK tax.
This means that if your investments grow, you wonât have to pay capital gains tax on any future
                    profits.
And if youâre investing for income, you wonât pay UK income tax either, which means you could save
                    thousands of
                    pounds in tax over the long term.
But remember tax rules change and benefits depend on individual circumstances.
You have the flexibility to take money out whenever you need to, but because of the excellent tax
                    benefits, the
                    government limits how much you can put into ISAs each tax year.
This is known as the ISA allowance, it changes from year to year, but for the current year you can
                    pay in up to
                    Â£20,000 and you have until the 5th of April to use this or youâll lose it.
How you choose to use your ISA allowance is up to you.
You can invest it all in a Stocks and Shares ISA, or you can spread your allowance between any
                    combination of the
                    other ISAs available, including Cash, Innovative Finance and if eligible, Lifetime ISAs.
A Stocks and Shares ISA gives you the freedom to invest in a wide range of investments, including
                    funds and UK and international shares and bonds.
You can also hold cash, so you can secure your valuable tax break now, and then chose the investments
                    when youâre
                    ready.
If youâre looking for a simple and tax-efficient way to save for the future, a Stocks and Shares ISA
                    is an
                    excellent option.
You can start investing with a lump sum of Â£100 or Â£25 per month.
Unlike cash, investments can fall as well as rise in value so you could get back less than you
                    invest. Tax rules
                    can change and the tax benefits of ISAs will depend on your circumstances. This video isnât personal
                    advice, if
                    youâre not sure whether an investment is right for you, please contact us for advice.

2. To be eligible for the offer, you must be a new client. A new client is a person

                                    month period will commence from the date the cash payment is made into the account.
                                    If you open a HL Account with a transfer in of assets, the 12 month period will
                                    begin from the date the first transfer of assets is received by HL from the previous
                                    provider.
4. The value of your Satisfaction Promise Refund will be based on the total amount of
                                    annual charges you have paid us from the date of account opening until closure of

5. To request your refund, all you need to do is contact our Helpdesk on 0117 900

                                    made into your Loyalty Bonus account from which we will automatically pay it out to

10. Our standard terms relating to your HL Account continue to apply (the Terms and
                                    Conditions of the HL Service) and are not affected in any way by this offer other

                                    providing notice on our website at www.hl.co.uk. We will provide at least 30 daysâ
                                    notice of our intention to withdraw the offer. In the event of a closure of this

                            it receives its first email. You can reply to emails and send from aliases anonymously too!
                        
Let's say a spammer gets hold of one of your aliases and starts
                        sending unsolicited email to it. You can simply toggle a switch in your dashboard and deactivate
                        that alias.
Our system will then silently discard any further emails and
                        you won't be forwarded anything else for that alias.
You can also delete the alias. Then our system will reject any
                        emails and respond with an error.
Generate new aliases in a couple of clicks straight from your
                            browser using the open-source browser extension.
The extension is available for download on Firefox and Chrome!
Also available on other chromium based browsers such as Brave and
                            Vivaldi.
Bring your own GPG/OpenPGP public keys and add them per recipient.
                    
You can then easily toggle encryption on and off. With encryption on, all
                        forwarded messages will be encrypted with your public key. Only you will be able to decrypt them
                        with the corresponding private key. You can even hide and encrypt the email subject!
This is great if you are using Gmail or Outlook and wish to prevent any
                        inbox snooping.
If you have your own domain you can add it and use it exactly
                            like your username subdomain aliases e.g. alias@example.com.
You can also enable or disable the catch-all functionality
                            for each of your domains.
You can then manage your aliases and deactivate/delete any that
                            start receiving spam!
If you don't like the fact that all your aliases contain your
                        username then you can generate random unique aliases from your dashboard.
The generated aliases will look something like this
                        x481n904@anonaddy.me or circus.waltz449@anonaddy.me

This prevents anyone linking ownership of the alias to you.
Reply anonymously to forwarded emails, the sender will
                            receive the email as if it has come from the alias.
You can even initiate an email conversation by sending an email
                            from one of your aliases.
Your real email address is not revealed when replying or
                            sending from an alias.
You can add additional usernames to your account and use them exactly
                        like the one you signed up with.
So if you signed up as johndoe you can add johnsmith as an additional
                        username and then use anyalias@johnsmith.anonaddy.com too.
This can be used to compartmentalise your aliases. You could have a
                        username for work emails a different one for personal emails etc.
If you'd like an alias to go to more than one recipient you can
                            easily add multiple recipients from your dashboard.
You can even add recipients to an alias as it is created by doing
                            alias+2.3.4@user.anonaddy.com

Where 2,3 and 4 are the keys for existing recipients in your
                            account.
Manage your aliases, recipients, domains and additional usernames
                            using the addy.io API.
In order to use the API you first need to generate an API access
                            token in your account settings.

Our team has over 35 years of combined experience focused solely on assisting with the management of corporate retirement plans. We assist our plan sponsors with navigating the complexities of ERISA through an independent and comprehensive approach. In the complex world of retirement plans, Experience Matters.
As a retirement plan sponsor, you are creating an opportunity for plan participants to reach their retirement plan goals, but to do so you will need to follow a process. As your retirement plan consultant, we will help you manage that process from A to Z and we do this through in-depth industry knowledge of the retirement plans and through available tools and resources.
ERISA rules are very clear: Every decision you make as a fiduciary must be in the best interests of plan participants and their beneficiaries. We help you make informed decisions.
The end starts with âZâ â creating opportunities for plan participants to retire. Advizrs believes this can be accomplished through our âZ Plan Optimizationâ approach to plan management support.Â  With a focus on key areas of the retirement plan offering, we strive to help plan sponsors balance company values with creating successful participant outcomes.

Your privacy is important to us
Akismet is the most powerful anti‑spam service for the web. Akismet works by checking all your comments against our constantly‑growing global spam database to remove irrelevant, malicious content before it gets published and damages your site’s credibility.Akismet gets increasingly effective over time: the more it learns, the more it protects. Its algorithms are continuously learning from content marked as spam across websites, so it more accurately detects and removes spam from sites in the future.When Akismet is enabled on your site, only the personal data needed to carry out Akismet’s core function of protecting your site against comment spam is collected from commenters on your site. We do not sell the data you send to the Akismet service, and we do not keep it for long. We have short retention periods of between two weeks and ninety days for the vast majority of our spam‑related data, at which point it is automatically deleted from our databases. Anyone can opt‑out of all long‑term tracking for the very small subset of data we do keep longer by using our contact form. For more information, please visit the Automattic Privacy Notice.

Algorand Foundation
Denver, February 17th, 2022 â The Algorand Foundation today announced a $10,000,000 USD SupaGrant to be rewarded among teams that will explore and accelerate the technical work needed to deliver EVM compatibility on Algorand. This will enable those innovators looking to leverage Algorandâs high performance, sustainable and cost effective blockchain but are already accustomed to building on EVM. 
â
Research and developer teams will be expected to submit their proposals no later than 18 March, 2022 outlining the methodology of their research, estimated costs and timeline through the call for proposals. Multiple teams may be chosen with the reward being split among the competing teams.
â
âAlgorand believes in a multi-chain world and this SupaGrant will move us towards that inevitability,â said Staci Warden, CEO Algorand Foundation. âRunning smart contracts written for Ethereum on Algorand eliminates the barriers for popular DeFi protocols and NFT projects to serve multiple chains while significantly decreasing the costs to those who participate. We believe that incentivizing experienced developer teams to research and build long lasting fundamental technology for Algorand will benefit the entire blockchain community.â
â
Research and developer teams participating in the SupaGrant are welcome to use any technology of their choosing to achieve EVM compatibility. 
â
About Algorandâs SupaGrants Program
Algorandâs SupaGrant is a supercharged grant program that targets experienced R&D teams and organizations to research or build secure and high-quality solutions for the Algorand ecosystem. 
â
The Algorand Foundation seeks to support these projects financially on a long-term basis, aiding them in their research costs, marketing, and other support they might need.
â
About the Algorand Foundation
The Algorand blockchain -- designed by MIT professor and Turing Award winning cryptographer Silvio Micali â is uniquely capable of delivering on the promise of a borderless global economy. It achieves transaction throughputs at the speed of traditional finance, but with immediate finality, near zero transaction costs, and on a 24/7 basis. Its carbon-neutral platform and unique pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism solves for the âblockchain trilemmaâ by achieving both security and scalability on a decentralized protocol, and without a second of downtime since it went live in 2019.
â
The Algorand Foundation is dedicated to helping fulfill the global promise of the Algorand blockchain by taking responsibility for its sound monetary supply economics, decentralized governance, and healthy and prosperous open-source ecosystem.

GnuPG  for VMS - A Public-Key Encryption/Decryption Utility



Excerpt from the GnuPG Web Page:

GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as
defined by
RFC4880 (also known as
PGP).  GnuPG allows to encrypt and sign your data and communication,
features a versatile key management system as well as access modules for
all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a
command line tool with features for easy integration with other
applications. A wealth of
frontend
applications and
libraries
are available.

GnuPG 1.4.23 for VMS




GnuPG 1.4.23 VMS-Ready Kits


VMS port notes (as included in the source-only and complete kits,
below).  This document describes the changes required to build GnuPG
version 1.4.23 on VMS.


/ftp/gnupg/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms/vms_notes.txt


Source-only kit (about 6MB) including:


Source (original and modified).



/ftp/gnupg/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms/gnupg-1_4_23a_src.zip


Complete kit (about 19MB), including:


Source (original and modified).

Alpha objects and executables (built on VMS V8.4 with HP C V7.3-010).

IA64 objects and executables (built on VMS V8.4 with HP C V7.3-020).

VAX objects and executables (built on VMS V7.3 with Compaq C V6.4-005).



/ftp/gnupg/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms.zip


Note that support for extended file names on ODS5 file systems depends
on relatively recent C RTL features, as found in VMS V7.3-2 or VMS
V7.3-1 with VMS731_ACRTL V3.0.

The Zip archive for the complete kit was created using the Zip "-V"
option to preserve the VMS file attributes, but the source files in
these Zip archives should be usable on a non-VMS system.



Additional Notes for the GnuPG 1.4.23 Kits Above



Few problems have been reported, but this product has not been well
tested.  Some caution would be prudent.


user's default directory (SYS$LOGIN) does not exist.  This should be
corrected in a future release.


Except for the mlock() code and some file size determination code, this
work is generally independent of the previous HP-supplied GnuPG
1.4.7/1.2.4/1.2.3 kits.  Among other things, this means that the
VMS-specific "entropy gathering" code here is different, and may be
better or worse than the older, HP-supplied code.  (The code here,
[.cipher]rndvms.c, spawns DCL commands, and processes the output,
roughly like the non-/dev/random UNIX code in [.cipher]rndunix.c.  This
should make it easier to modify, if more suitable DCL commands can be
found.)  If the quality of the entropy gathered by this code is
suspected of being insufficient, it should be possible to generate keys
on a different host system type where this would not be a problem, and
to import those keys into the keyrings on the VMS system.

GnuPG 1.4.23 for VMS




GnuPG 1.4.23 VMS-Ready Kits


VMS port notes (as included in the source-only and complete kits,
below).  This document describes the changes required to build GnuPG
version 1.4.23 on VMS.


/ftp/gnupg/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms/vms_notes.txt


Source-only kit (about 6MB) including:


Source (original and modified).



/ftp/gnupg/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms/gnupg-1_4_23a_src.zip


Complete kit (about 19MB), including:


Source (original and modified).

Alpha objects and executables (built on VMS V8.4 with HP C V7.3-010).

IA64 objects and executables (built on VMS V8.4 with HP C V7.3-020).

VAX objects and executables (built on VMS V7.3 with Compaq C V6.4-005).



/ftp/gnupg/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms/gnupg-1_4_23a_vms.zip


Note that support for extended file names on ODS5 file systems depends
on relatively recent C RTL features, as found in VMS V7.3-2 or VMS
V7.3-1 with VMS731_ACRTL V3.0.

The Zip archive for the complete kit was created using the Zip "-V"
option to preserve the VMS file attributes, but the source files in
these Zip archives should be usable on a non-VMS system.



Additional Notes for the GnuPG 1.4.23 Kits Above



Few problems have been reported, but this product has not been well
tested.  Some caution would be prudent.


user's default directory (SYS$LOGIN) does not exist.  This should be
corrected in a future release.


Except for the mlock() code and some file size determination code, this
work is generally independent of the previous HP-supplied GnuPG
1.4.7/1.2.4/1.2.3 kits.  Among other things, this means that the
VMS-specific "entropy gathering" code here is different, and may be
better or worse than the older, HP-supplied code.  (The code here,
[.cipher]rndvms.c, spawns DCL commands, and processes the output,
roughly like the non-/dev/random UNIX code in [.cipher]rndunix.c.  This
should make it easier to modify, if more suitable DCL commands can be
found.)  If the quality of the entropy gathered by this code is
suspected of being insufficient, it should be possible to generate keys
on a different host system type where this would not be a problem, and
to import those keys into the keyrings on the VMS system.

Please read below to use the site properly.
Registered users can upload Video files only, up to 400Mb each.Multiple file upload is not available (except on multiple browser tabs).
3 random Videos among all uploaded are automatically displayed into the left sidebar, except yours and those you already downloaded.
You just have to refresh the page to see 3 other random ones.
Users must upload at least the same Kb quantity they want to download.
					You can see your "quota" at the top right of the page, once connected.

					anyVIDz staff ensures privacy protection and unfiltered publication.				
					However to comply with laws, illegal posts such as underage stuff uploads are strictly prohibited. 
					Since anyVIDz staff cannot manually download and check all files one by one, a fork of open_nsfw is used to automatically detect and remove illicit content.
					Hence like any other automated moderation system, this is not perfect and can miss out offensive content.
					anyVIDz staff cannot be considered as responsible for any content uploaded by users until it has been reported.
					Unfortunately, before being moderated, this kind of unwanted content can pop-up into the selection sidebar. Be aware of that.
					If you want to report illegal or harmful content that the system missed out, please follow this guide below:

Indeed for security and operational matters, this kind of ID is temporary and randomly generated on-demand, and does not match with any recorded data set related to uploaded Video.
This is the reason why you must generate the MD5 hash of videos (and not the previews) you want to make erase, then send the hash list within the anyVIDz Support Chat.

When you visit our Properties, open or click on emails we send you, or interact with our advertisements, we or third parties we work with may automatically collect certain information using some of the tracking technologies described below.
"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a website for the purpose of collecting data to facilitate and enhance your communication and interaction with that website. Such data may include, for example, the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited our Properties, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what pages in the Properties you visited and what links you clicked on, the region where your device is located, and geographic information based on your IP data. We may store some information on your device or device hard drive as a cookie or similar type of file (such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, and similar technologies that work on mobile devices) to collect data related to usage of the Properties. We may also use cookies to customize your visit to the Properties and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance the Properties and Services.
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Properties. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of aggregate information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Website or App, how visitors navigate throughout the Properties, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Properties and our Services.
We may work with third-party vendors who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Properties and other Services. One such provider is Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (âGoogleâ). Google Analytics uses cookies to help analyze how users use the Website. The information generated by these cookies about your use (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, interacting with advertisements, and providing other services relating to web page activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. By using the Website and accepting cookies, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Please refer to the currently available opt-outs for Google Analytics by visiting Â https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
If you interact with us on social media or use features, such as plugins, widgets, or other tools made available by social media platforms or networks (such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or Google) in connection with our Properties, we may collect information that you share with us on social media or that such platforms share with us. Please review the privacy policies and settings of the social media platforms and networks that you use for more information about their privacy practices.
We may obtain Arena Data from certain Arena Partners and their vendors, which we process on behalf of such Arena Partners in accordance with our contracts with them.
We may obtain data through your interactions with our Apps available through Apple iOS and Google Play. Such data may include your approximate location and device ID. When such data is collected, it is used only on a transient basis and therefore not retained.
We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as data analytics providers, marketing or advertising vendors, fraud prevention vendors, vendors that provide other services on our behalf, or publicly available sources.
We collect and use personal information for the following purposes:
With respect to our Services as they apply to the Arena Data that certain Arena Partners direct us to collect, in some instances we do not process or use such Arena Data on our own behalf but rather at the direction and for the benefit of those Arena Partners who act as controllers. In other instances, we may act as the controller of such data. Some of our Arena Partners find that advertising is more effective and relevant when it is targeted to your interests and behaviors. In connection with our processing of Arena Data relevant to your possible interests and behaviors, some of our Arena Partners may employ various technologies to determine whether you have seen their advertisements or to create a profile to determine likely associations or connections between your devices. One use of such information is to provide more tailored advertising, marketing, measurement, analytics, and research about goods and services of interest to you across those various devices. Such information may form part of the Arena Data that we process on behalf of those Arena Partners.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please refer to the relevant Arena Partnersâ privacy policies and the Your Choices section of this Privacy Policy.
We may collect information that is not personal information (âNon-personal Informationâ). Non-personal Information may include anonymous or aggregate data, or information lawfully made available from federal, state, or local government records. Because Non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use, and disclose such information for any purpose permitted by law. For example, we may aggregate or de-identify Personal Information so that the information does not personally identify you or anyone else. We reserve the right to develop and derive aggregate data (meaning information that relates to a group or category of individuals, from which individual identities have been removed) from personal information in order to enhance and maintain the Properties, and such aggregate data will be treated as non-personal information.
In addition to using your personal information ourselves for the reasons stated above (and as otherwise mentioned in this Privacy Policy), we may disclose your personal information to other affiliates and entities in the following instances:
We may share your personal information with third-party vendors who may use your information to provide us with services including, but not limited to, website hosting, data analysis, infrastructure provision, information technology services, customer service, email delivery services, payment processing, auditing, and anti-fraud monitoring. These vendors may have access to personal information that is necessary to perform their functions, but they are only permitted to do so in connection with performing services for us. They are not authorized by us to use your personal information for their own benefit.
We may share personal information with our corporate affiliates and subsidiaries, who process personal information on our behalf, where necessary to provide a product or service that you have requested, or in other circumstances with your consent or as permitted or required by law.
We may share your personal information with third parties who partner with us to promote products and services, provide marketing and advertisements, conduct data analytics, or use the data for other commercial purposes. We do not control how these third parties use and share your personal information once they receive it. You will need to contact such third parties directly for information about their privacy practices or to exercise any rights you may have (including if you would like to opt-out of marketing messages).
We may disclose personal information and other information as we believe necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our Terms and Conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
We may share your personal information and other information with third parties in connection with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of the assets of the Company, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which the assets transferred may include information about the users of our Properties.
We may share non-personal information with unaffiliated third parties, such as business and advertising partners, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, to improve and enhance your experience using the Properties, and for our own market research activities.
Please note that if you specifically consent to additional uses of your personal information, we may use your personal information in a manner consistent with that consent.
With respect to Arena Data, certain Arena Partners provide us with instructions on what to do with such information. For example, an Arena Partner may request that Arkadium compile reporting of aggregated user metrics and data associated with Arena performance, such as average player session duration, number of game plays, number of users, and scores. These choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification, or deletion of Arena Data. Our Arena Partners and their affiliates determine their own policies for the sharing and disclosure of Arena Data. We may transfer Arena Data to third parties on our Arena Partnersâ behalf, and under such circumstances, we do so strictly according to our Arena Partnersâ instructions.
We may create links to other websites that we think may be of interest to you, such as providers of various products and services. We may also provide links that allow you to send or forward a post from our Properties through or to third-party social media sites, or other means of electronic communication, such as an email or text messaging service. We do not endorse any other websites, providers, or services by providing such links, and this Privacy Policy applies only to your use of our Properties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of any websites and services we link to on our Properties, and you should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what data that site may collect about you.
The Properties may also integrate with social media services. We do not control such services and are not liable for the manner in which they operate. While we may provide you with the ability to use such services in connection with our Properties, we are doing so merely as an accommodation and, like you, are relying upon those third-party services to operate properly and fairly.
You should be aware that any personal information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, forum, social network, or otherwise may be viewed and used by others. By using such features, you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.
Our third-party partners or vendors may use your information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit our Properties or other websites. Cookies, clickstream data, and other similar technologies described below may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, our partner or vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product. This form of advertising, sometimes called âtargeted advertising,â âbehavioral advertising,â or âcross-context behavioral advertising,â enables our partners and vendors to know about your interests in connection with the delivery of a specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because it allows you to see advertisements that are relevant to your interests.
If you would like to opt out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described in the section titled Your Choices below.
Please note that if you opt in and consent to receive in-game SMS messages, we will not share your mobile telephone number or other mobile identifier with any third parties or affiliates for their marketing or promotional purposes.
We may use your information to help us, or our third-party vendors, determine if you have interacted with our Properties across multiple devices and to match such devices. To accomplish this, we may rely on information (including demographic, geographic and interest-based data) from third parties such as data vendors, pursuant to their own privacy policies, or we may use information we collect in conjunction with such third-party data. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated with each other and may further provide services to our advertisers to better enable cross-device targeting and analysis. To opt-out of or restrict our use of certain cross-device data, please see the section titled Your Choices below.
Personal information is maintained on our servers or those of our vendors, and is accessible by authorized employees, independent contractors, representatives, and agents as necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy. We use reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to promote the security of our systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of personal information. However, no method of safeguarding information is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will be effective or sufficient. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at .
We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Properties, and for a reasonable time thereafter in accordance with our standard procedures or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. If you have an account with us, we will retain your account, marketing and user-provided data until you can cancel your account or request deletion of your personal information. Even if we delete some or all of your information, we may continue to retain and use anonymous or aggregate data, or any other data that constitutes non-personal information. Please note that we will not be liable for disclosures of your data due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.
Consistent with applicable law, you may exercise the choices described in this section regarding your personal information and communications from us. You may also have certain additional rights available depending on laws in your state or country of residence, as described further below in the Privacy Policy.
We may send you marketing messages via email, or by SMS message if you consent to receive such text messages. We may also send you in-game SMS messages if you opt in and consent to receive such text messages. If you receive a marketing or in-game message from us, you may unsubscribe from future messages in accordance with our standard unsubscribe process (such as by using the unsubscribe link included in an email or replying STOP to a text message), or by sending an unsubscribe request to us at . We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Please note that if you opt out in this manner, certain aspects of our services may no longer be available to you.
If you would like to stop or restrict the placement of cookies or flush any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to and adjust your web browser preferences. Further information on cookies is available at Â www.allaboutcookies.org. By deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our Properties or some of its functionality may be affected.
Note that cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. Additionally, if you opt out on one of your devices, that opt out may not be effective on all of your devices. However, please be advised that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on some mobile services.
Some browsers have a Do Not Track (âDNTâ) feature that lets users signal to websites that they do not want to have their online activities tracked. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. However, if you are a resident of California, Virginia or Colorado, we treat Global Privacy Control signals or other accepted universal opt out signals, when such signals are available and readable, as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal information, or of opting out of the processing of personal information for targeted advertising, as applicable. Please see the sections titled California Privacy Rights and Other State Privacy Rights below for more information.
You may opt out of receiving targeted ads from certain data and advertising partners that participate in certain industry self-regulatory programs. The DAA provides a website atÂ www.aboutads.info/consumers with information about how to opt out of targeted advertising from some or all of the DAAâs participating companies. Additionally, the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ) offers a website at  http://optout.networkadvertising.org where you can opt out of interest-based advertising from some or all of the NAIâs members. Please note that by opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities. In the event that we perform cross-device matching (as described above), once you have opted out on one device (âOpted-Out Deviceâ), we will not use any new data from the Opted-Out Device to identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes, and we will not use data from another device for interest-based advertising purposes on the Opted-Out Device.
For targeted advertisements delivered through mobile apps, users may opt out of certain ads or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings. To learn how to limit ad tracking or to reset the advertising identifier on your iOS and Android device, visit the following links:
You can also install the DAAâs AppChoices app on your device to opt out of targeted advertising by certain providers, and to select system-level advertising preferences on your device (such as âLimit Ad Trackingâ on Apple devices, or âOpt-out of Interest-based adsâ on Android devices).
Finally, to learn more from the NAI about how to opt out of targeted advertising on mobile devices, you can also visit the following link: Â https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/.
If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt out of the sale of certain personal information that we have collected (or may collect) from you to data brokers or other third parties. You can exercise this right by emailing us at  with the subject line âNevada Do Not Sell Request.â
If you submit personal information to us, that information may be processed in a jurisdiction where privacy laws may be less stringent than those in your country of residence. By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of such information in foreign jurisdictions including, but not limited to, the United States. Please note that personal information transferred to the United States is subject to access by law enforcement. Where applicable, we may use model clauses approved by the laws of your jurisdiction (such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission) for cross-border data transfers.

If we become aware that personal information (or other information that is protected under applicable law) from a child under 16 has been collected, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our databases. If you believe we might have any personal information from or about a child under 16, please contact us by using the information the section below titled Contacting Us.

Any updated version of this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Properties after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your personal information in a manner materially different from what was stated at the time your personal information was collected. We encourage you to periodically review the Website for the latest information on our privacy practices.

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (âCCPAâ), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information. This section describes the rights that California consumers have and explains how to exercise those rights. For the purposes of this section, personal information does not include: (i) information that is lawfully made available from federal, state or local government records; (ii) de-identified or aggregated data; or (iii) information excluded from the scope of the CCPA. These rights are granted only to the extent that you are a California consumer and we are acting as a âbusinessâ under the CCPA with respect to your personal information. The rights in this section are not intended to grant you additional rights, but only your rights under the CCPA.
General information regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information is set forth in the Privacy Policy above. To help consumers make informed privacy decisions, the CCPA defines personal information by discrete categories. Information about our data practices pertaining to these categories of personal information can be found below (some types of personal information may apply to multiple categories).
In order to provide our Services to our Arena Partners, we may process Arena Data that we receive from or on behalf of them. If you are a California resident, you may have certain CCPA rights pertaining to such information. Under the CCPA, when we act as a âservice providerâ (not as a âbusinessâ or a âthird partyâ) over such information, we only process your information through our Services as necessary to provide our services to our Arena Partners, at their direction. If you wish to exercise any of your rights under CCPA with respect to such information, please contact the relevant business that collected the information from you, who controls and determines how your information is processed.

However, we maybe retain personal information that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) in order to perform certain actions set forth under CCPA, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.
You have the right to request a copy of personal information we have collected and maintained about you in the past 12 months. The CCPA allows you to request your information from us up to twice during a 12-month period. We will provide our response in a readily usable (and usually electronic) format.
You have the right to request the correction of any personal information we maintain about you.
You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, along with the right to opt in to the sale of such information.

To our knowledge, we do not sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Consumers who have provided us requested materials offline that contain SPI may contact us directly at  to assert any applicable privacy rights.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, including but not limited to, by:Denying you goods or services.

In some instances, we may request additional information to help us identify you. When providing us this information, you represent and affirm that all information provided is true and accurate. If we are unable to verify that the consumer submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected personal information, we may contact you for more information, or we may not be able to meet your request.
Only you, or an agent legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information.

For example, we may reward you with a gift card if you win a sweepstakes, or in connection with other offers. When we offer our Programs to you, we believe that the value of the different pricing or services you receive exceeds the cost of providing your personal information. Your participation in these Programs is completely optional and subject to the terms provided to you at the time you sign up.
You may withdraw from participation in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program rules.

France's Gendarmerie Nationale, the country's national police force, says it has saved millions of dollars by migrating its desktop software infrastructure away from Microsoft Windows and replacing it with the Ubuntu Linux distribution.
The Gendarmerie began its transition to open source software in 2005 when it replaced Microsoft Office with OpenOffice.org across the entire organization. It gradually adopted other open source software applications, including Firefox and Thunderbird. After the launch of Windows Vista in 2006, it decided to phase out Windows and incrementally migrate to Ubuntu. 
Moving from Microsoft XP to Vista would not have brought us many advantages and Microsoft said it would require training of users. Moving from XP to Ubuntu, however, proved very easy.
At the current stage of the migration, it has adopted Ubuntu on 5,000 workstations. Based on the success of this pilot migration, it plans to move forward and switch a total of 15,000 workstations to Ubuntu by the end of the year. It aims to have the entire organization, and all 90,000 of its workstations, running the Linux distribution by 2015.
A report published by the European Commission's Open Source Observatory provides some details from a recent presentation given by Gendarmerie Lieutenant-Colonel Xavier Guimard, who says that the Gendarmerie has been able to reduced its annual IT budget by 70 percent without having to reduce its capabilities.
Since 2004, he says that the Gendarmerie has saved up to ï¿½50 million on licensing and maintenance costs as a result of the migration strategy.  He believes that the move from Windows to Ubuntu posed fewer challenges than the organization would have faced if it had updated to Windows Vista.
"Moving from Microsoft XP to Vista would not have brought us many advantages and Microsoft said it would require training of users," said Lt. Col. Guimard. "Moving from XP to Ubuntu, however, proved very easy. The two biggest differences are the icons and the games. Games are not our priority."
Support for open standards is a key part of the Gendarmerie's emerging IT policy. Standards-based technologies give it more freedom to choose which vendors it adopts and also makes it easier for the Gendarmerie to interoperate with other government networks. It has found that open source software is better at handling open standards. Linux has also simplified remote maintenance tasks.
Linux has also been adopted by several other government agencies in France. The French National Assembly runs Ubuntu on over 1,000 workstations and the Ministry of Agriculture uses Mandriva Linux.
The success of the Gendarmerie Ubuntu migration reflects several emerging trends in IT. First, it represents the rising influence of community-driven distros which are largely supported internally by the organizations that adopt them. Analysts have noted a growing preference for this approach which can be cheaper than adopting a conventional enterprise distro like Red Hat with annual commercial support contracts.
The Gendarmerie migration also demonstrates the significant cost savings that governments can get from adopting open source software. As the global financial downturn continues to put pressure on budgets, governments are going to increasingly look to open source software as a way to cut IT costs. We have recently seen moves in this direction from Canada and the UK.

	A Shahzia Sikander sculpture has become the subject of controversy after a powerful anti-abortion group claimed that the work promotes “satanic” imagery.

	The sculpture, which was acclaimed by critics when it appeared in New York’s Madison Square Park last year, was intended to explore the relationship between femininity and power. 

	Titled Witness (2023), the work features a female figure who levitates above the ground, her arms and legs dissolving into rootlike forms. She floats within the armature of a hoop skirt that contains mosaics depicting plants. She wears a lacy collar in allusion to similar ones worn by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late Supreme Court justice.

					Having Excelled as a Painter, Shahzia Sikander Is Mastering an Unexpected New Medium: Sculpture		
			








	Sikander has said that the work, which debuted alongside another sculpture, was, in part, a response to the paring back of abortion rights in the United States, including the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade.

	Amid those developments, Sikander wrote in a statement accompanying the work, came a dismissal of “the indefatigable spirit of women who have been collectively fighting for their right to their own bodies over generations. However, the enduring power lies with the people who step into and remain in the fight for equality. That spirit and grit is what I want to capture in both the sculptures.”



	Now, the work is to appear next week at the University of Houston in Texas. Some conservative groups have called for it not to go on view at all, calling its imagery abject.

	Earlier this month, Texas Right to Life, a self-described “pro-life” organization that has been credited with helping undo Roe v. Wade, claimed the work enlists “satanic imagery to honor abortion and memorialize the late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” although it did not describe what that imagery was. (Sikander’s artist statement about the work contains no mention of satanism.)

	“Disobedience to God certainly should not be esteemed by society, much less lauded with a statue,” the group wrote. “On the contrary, art should reflect truth, goodness, and beauty: three timeless values that reveal the nature of God. Art cannot have beauty without truth. Art cannot have truth without goodness. A statue honoring child sacrifice has no place in Texas.”



	The Sikander work has previously been a subject of controversy in conservative media, with Fox News having run a report on X users calling the sculpture “demonic” in 2023.

	Sikander did not respond to a request for comment for this article.

Axios reported that Texas Right to Life had been referring to a booklet about Witness published by the Madison Square Park Conservancy that mentioned Abrahamic religions, which refer to horned beings.

	“The trope is not the artist’s alone: horned gods and goddesses abound in world religions, from ancient Egypt and Greece to other parts and eras of Africa and Europe. In the Abrahamic faiths the horned beast is associated with forces of evil, chaos, and destruction—the devil himself,” critic Aruna D’Souza writes in the booklet. 

	D’Souza continues, “but again, Sikander reveals to us what’s really at stake in such conceptions. In the biblical story of creation, Satan and Eve are intertwined the way a snake wraps around a tree limb; woman is the vehicle for iniquity, the temptress, the instrument of evil. Sikander takes this idea, one that runs through so many cultures and epochs and philosophies—of woman as a threat, as an embodiment of unspeakable desire, as taint—and turns negativity into power. Her Eve, her Havah, sports her horns like a crown, as a point of pride. She understands the endless projections onto herself as her strength.”

	In an FAQ about Witness, the University of Houston acknowledged that the work might be “offensive to some people,” adding that “the sculpture has braids shaped like ram horns, representing the unification of disparate strands. Ram horns have significance in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as Central and South Asian beliefs, often associated with power and valor. The artist has said the braids link to one of her paintings that represents the courage, fluidity and resilience of the feminine.”

	Following the controversy, the University of Houston ended up canceling the opening and an artist’s talk planned for the sculpture. After the cancelation, Sikander told the Art Newspaper, “Art should be about discourse and not censorship. Shame on those that silence artists.”

	The Sikander sculpture is the latest in a series of artworks that right-wing groups have labeled “satanic.” Others include performances by Marina Abramović and a Simone Leigh sculpture that temporarily appeared in the former site of a Robert E. Lee monument in New Orleans.

Update, 2/27/24, 10:55 a.m.: This article has been updated to include mention of the canceled opening for the sculpture.

We are archiving Atom and all projects under the Atom organization for an official sunset on December 15, 2022.

January 30, 2023 Update: Update to the previous version of Atom before February 2

On December 7, 2022, GitHub detected unauthorized access to a set of repositories used in the planning and development of Atom. After a thorough investigation, we have concluded there was no risk to GitHub.com services as a result of this unauthorized access.
A set of encrypted code signing certificates were exfiltrated; however, the certificates were password-protected and we have no evidence of malicious use. As a preventative measure, we will revoke the exposed certificates used for the Atom application. Revoking these certificates will invalidate some versions of Atom.
These versions of Atom will stop working on February 2. To keep using Atom, users will need to download a previous Atom version.
Read more on our blog, including next steps for impacted Desktop users.

November 16, 2022 Update: We’ve since updated our blog post to include additional information about what you can expect after the sunset of Atom on December 15, 2022. See below for specifics.

When we introduced Atom in 2011, we set out to give developers a text editor that was deeply customizable but also easy to use—one that made it possible for more people to build software. While that goal of growing the software creator community remains, we’ve decided to retire Atom in order to further our commitment to bringing fast and reliable software development to the cloud via Microsoft Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces.
On June 8, 2022, we announced that we will sunset Atom and archive all projects under the organization on December 15, 2022.
Atom has not had significant feature development for the past several years, though we’ve conducted maintenance and security updates during this period to ensure we’re being good stewards of the project and product. As new cloud-based tools have emerged and evolved over the years, Atom community involvement has declined significantly. As a result, we’ve decided to sunset Atom so we can focus on enhancing the developer experience in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.
This is a tough goodbye. It’s worth reflecting that Atom has served as the foundation for the Electron framework, which paved the way for the creation of thousands of apps, including Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Slack, and our very own GitHub Desktop. However, reliability, security, and performance are core to GitHub, and in order to best serve the developer community, we are archiving Atom to prioritize technologies that enable the future of software development.
We recognize that Atom is still used by the community and want to acknowledge that migrating to an alternative solution takes time and energy. We are committed to helping users and contributors plan for their migration.
GitHub and our community have benefited tremendously from those who have filed issues, created extensions, fixed bugs, and built new features on Atom. Atom played an integral part in many developers’ journeys, and we look forward to building and shaping the next chapter of software development together.
Get tips, technical guides, and best practices right in your inbox.
Update to the latest version of Desktop and previous version of Atom before February 2.
Our most advanced AI offering to date is customized to your organizationâs knowledge and codebase, infusing GitHub Copilot throughout the software development lifecycle.

Margaret Keenan was given the vaccine by May Parsons, at University Hospital in Coventry
A UK grandmother has become the first person in the world to be given the Pfizer Covid-19 jab as part of a mass vaccination programme.
Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said the injection she received at 06:31 GMT was the "best early birthday present".
It was the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be dispensed in the coming weeks.
Up to four million more are expected by the end of the month. 
Hubs in the UK are starting the rollout by vaccinating the over-80s and some health and care staff.
Senior NHS sources told the BBC "thousands of vaccinations" had taken place across the UK on Tuesday.
Dubbing the day "V-day", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was "a tribute to scientific endeavour and human ingenuity and to the hard work of so many people. 
"Today marks the start of the fightback against our common enemy, the coronavirus," he said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on a visit to a London hospital to see some of the first people getting the jab, said getting vaccinated was "good for you and good for the whole country".
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "Today we should all allow ourselves a smile - but we must not drop our guard."
On Tuesday, the UK government reported a further 616 people had died within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total, by that measure, to 62,033. A further 12,282 people tested positive for the virus.

How the vaccine rollout unfolded â and how a certain William Shakespeare was involved
At University Hospital, Coventry, matron May Parsons administered the very first injection to Ms Keenan.
"I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19," said Ms Keenan, who is originally from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh.
"It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year, after being on my own for most of the year.
"My advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it. If I can have it at 90, then you can have it too," she added.
Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, who witnessed the "historic moment", said: "We couldn't hug her but we could clap, and everybody did so in the room."
Throughout the day, patients and health workers at some 50 hospitals around the UK have been getting the jab: 
The UK is the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine after regulators approved its use last week.
On Tuesday, US regulators confirmed the vaccine is 95% effective, paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use.
The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has also been found to be "safe and effective", according to a paper published on Tuesday and assessed by independent scientists.

Matt Hancock says he is thrilled but warns that people must still stick to the rules
Speaking in the Commons, the health secretary stressed people did not need to apply for the vaccine. He said the NHS would be in touch with those eligible and urged them to "please step forward for your country".
Mr Hancock went on to warn that there was "still a long march ahead", saying there were "worrying signs" of the virus growing in Essex, London and Kent.
New data released by national statisticians for the week ending 27 November showed that of the 14,106 deaths registered in the UK, nearly 3,400 involved Covid. This is 20% higher than the five-year average but similar to the percentages seen in the past two weeks.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens called the first vaccinations "remarkable achievement", but cautioned it was a "first step" and "incredibly important" people continued to act sensibly.

Boris Johnson: 'It will gradually make a huge, huge difference... but we haven't defeated this virus yet"
On a visit to London's Guy's Hospital, the prime minister spoke to 81-year-old Lyn Wheeler, who was the first to receive the vaccine there.
"It is really very moving to hear her say she is doing it for Britain, which is exactly right - she is protecting herself, but also helping to protect the entire country," Mr Johnson said.
Earlier, he thanked the NHS, volunteers and "all of the scientists who worked so hard to develop this vaccine".
Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it was "absolutely fabulous" to see people getting the vaccine and thanked everyone involved in making it happen.
Some 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been secured by the government to be administered in the coming weeks - although vaccination is not compulsory.
Orders have been placed for 40 million in total - enough for 20 million people, as two courses are needed. However, most supplies are not expected to become available until next year.
Mr Hancock said he expected it to take "several weeks" to get the first group of health workers, care staff and over-80s vaccinated.
This is a momentous day, but make no mistake the NHS faces a huge task in rolling out this vaccine.
First, there needs to be a smooth supply - and already there are reports of manufacturing problems, which means the UK is expecting less than half of the 10 million doses of the Pfizer jab it was planning for by the end of the year.
The fact it needs to be kept in ultra-cold storage and in batches of 975 units is an added complication that has meant it cannot yet be taken into care homes to vaccinate residents - the very highest priority group - or sent out to GPs to run vaccination clinics in the community.
NHS bosses hope to receive guidance from the regulator next week on how to get around this.
But these factors illustrate why the UK is still pinning its hopes on a second vaccine developed by Oxford University. 
That one can be kept in fridges and so is easier to distribute, is British-made and - what is more - there is an ever-growing stockpile ready to use.
If that vaccine gets the green light from regulators, there will be a genuine hope the first few months of 2021 will see rapid progress in offering jabs to the most vulnerable people, so the UK can return to something closer to normality.

Master the chocolate cake with an airy, light sponge and rich buttercream filling. It's simple enough for an afternoon tea but special enough for a party too
Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment.
In a large bowl, beat together 200g golden caster sugar, 200g softened unsalted butter, 4 large eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, Â½ tsp vanilla extract, 2 tbsp milk and a pinch of salt until pale.
Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave, stirring every 30 secs. Leave the melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.
Mash 200g softened butter and 400g icing sugar together with a fork, then switch to a wooden spoon or electric beaters, if you have them.
Sift in 5 tbsp cocoa powder with a pinch of salt and pour in the melted chocolate and 2 tbsp milk. Mix again until smooth.
On a cake stand or large plate, sandwich the cakes together with half of the buttercream, then spread the rest on top. Decorate with chocolate shards, if you like.
To make chocolate shards: melt 50g dark chocolate and pour it onto a tray lined with baking parchment or foil.
Now melt 25g milk chocolate and 25g white chocolate and drizzle them over the dark chocolate before it sets.
Shake the tray gently to level the mixture then leave to set somewhere cool. Chop into shards.

From its humble beginnings as a military base, Clark is being transformed into a disaster-resilient metropolis that will be competitive and attractive to a global market. Clark stands for efficiency, things and processes that actually work, convenience for its inhabitants, and ease of doing business for all locators. This is, essentially, the inspiration for Clark's tagline, "It Works. Like A Dream."
Located in Central Luzon, New Clark City is at a confluence of industry and agriculture with existing infrastructure and connectivity to Manila and rest of the Philippines. With favorable location in the region and appropriate distance from Metro Manila, NCC is poised to become the next big metropolis.
The 240-hectare Bonifacio Global City is now one of the premier business and residential districts in the country, with a combined gross floor area of 1.8 million square meters to be built within the next three years.

A 25-hectare development right across Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3, Newport City exhibits one of the countryâs valued residential and office spaces. This âLeisure Capitalâ is also home to esteemed restaurants, first-class gaming facilities, and upscale retail stores.
Currently the countryâs longest expressway, SCTEx stretches for about 94km, which serves as an efficient transport passageway connecting Metro Manila to major infrastructures such as the Subic Bay Freeport and Clark International Airport through North Luzon Expressway

                Hello visitor. There may be several reasons why you are here - maybe you are not familiar with the Bible and you
were just browsing through the internet and just accidentally bumped into this page, or maybe you opened
this page searching for truth. Maybe you are already familiar with the Bible and it is illegal in your country
to read or own a Bible and for that reason, this project is also available in various networks, like
Tor, I2P, Freenet, Zeronet, IPFS, Lokinet or Yggdrasil to provide uncensored access.
For whatever reason you opened this page, you are welcome here and I invite you to
feel free to start reading.


            

                If you are new to the Bible, I encourage you to start with the Gospel of John. It provides basic overview of who Jesus is and about His mission.
Few other books I recommend to read after the Gospel of John are Romans, Proverbs, Psalms or the book of Genesis.
Also, if you have any questions about the Bible, about the stuff you read or if you are missing translation in your language,
feel free to contact us. So, are you ready to begin?

A network that runs without congestion.

Low Fees
Send money globally for pennies.

Simple
Easy to use. No hassles.

Secure
World's most robust blockchain technology.
Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash". Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.
All are welcome to join the Bitcoin Cash community as we move forward in creating sound money accessible to the whole world.
Send Money Anywhere In the World, Almost for Free
With Bitcoin Cash, you can send money to anyone, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Like the Internet itself, the network is always on.  No transaction is too big or too small.  And you never need anyoneâs permission or approval.
Be Your Own Bank and Have Full Control Over Your Money
The seizing of capital from account holders (âbail-insâ) that occurred in Cyprus and nearly in Greece, demonstrated that bank deposits are only as safe as political leaders decide.  Even under the best of conditions, banks can make mistakes, hold funds, freeze accounts, and otherwise prevent you from accessing your own money.
Banks can also decide to block your transactions, charge you fees, or close your account without warning.  Bitcoin Cash gives you full, sovereign control over your funds, which you can access from anywhere in the world.
A Scarce Digital Currency with a Known, Fixed Supply
The Bitcoin Cash protocol ensures there will never be more than 21 million coins in existence.  Governments constantly print money out of thin air, endlessly inflating the supply and devaluing everyoneâs savings. Bitcoin Cash has a fixed supply and therefore represents sound money.
Increase Your Privacy and Operate Anonymously
Bitcoin Cash offers more privacy and anonymity than traditional payment systems like bank transfers and credit card payments, since itâs normally impossible to know who controls a Bitcoin address.
Bitcoin Cash offers various levels of privacy depending on how it is used.  Itâs important to educate yourself thoroughly before using BCH for privacy purposes.
Enjoy Exclusive Discounts
Many merchants offer discounts for paying in Bitcoin Cash, because it eliminates credit card fees and helps grow the adoption of this new payment system.
Token Ecosystem
Storing and managing tokens on a blockchain provides greater transparency and integrity than traditional forms of asset accounting and trading. Bitcoin Cash supports token protocols that power a variety of projects, and it is easy to create your own token backed projects.
Support Freedom Worldwide
Bitcoin Cash is a permissionless, open network.  It empowers you to engage with your fellow human beings without intrusion.  Itâs decentralized, voluntary, and non-aggressive.  As usage grows, old power structures will erode while fresh ideas blossom.  It may help usher in the greatest peaceful revolution the world has ever known.
Ultra Low Fees
The network fee for a typical Bitcoin Cash transaction is less than one penny. If you want to convert your BCH into fiat currency, such as US dollars, you can do that through merchant processors for a cost that is still much lower than credit card processing.
No Chargebacks
Unlike credit cards, there are never any automatic voids, refunds, chargebacks, or other unexpected fees. Fraud protection is built into the system with no cost to the merchant.
New Customers
A growing number of patrons are choosing Bitcoin Cash as a preferred payment method.  They favor merchants who offer this payment option and actively seek them out.
Free Marketing and Press
By accepting Bitcoin Cash, merchants can gain free listings in website and app directories, gaining even more customers.  They can also take advantage of this new trend and generate press for their business.
In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the famous whitepaper entitled Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System.  In 2009, he released the first bitcoin software that powered the network, and it operated smoothly for several years with low fees, and fast, reliable transactions.
Unfortunately, from 2016 to 2017, Bitcoin became increasingly unreliable and expensive.  This was because the community could not reach consensus on increasing the network capacity. Some of the developers did not understand and agree with Satoshiâs plan. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer.
By 2017, Bitcoin dominance had plummeted from 95% to as low as 40% as a direct result of the usability problems.  Fortunately, a large portion of the Bitcoin community, including developers, investors, users, and businesses, still believed in the original vision of Bitcoin -- a low fee, peer to peer electronic cash system that could be used by all the people of the world.
On August 1st, 2017, we took the logical step of increasing the maximum block size, and Bitcoin Cash was born.  Anyone who held Bitcoin at that time (block 478558) became an owner of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).  The network now supports up to 32MB blocks with ongoing research to allow massive future increases.
With multiple independent teams of developers providing software implementations, the future is secure. Bitcoin Cash is resistant to political and social attacks on protocol development. No single group or project can control it.  Multiple implementations also provides redundancy to ensure that the network retains 100% uptime.
The bitcoincashresearch.org website is a good venue for making proposals for changes that require coordination across development teams. For those wishing to implement changes to the Bitcoin Cash protocol, it is recommended to seek early peer-review and engage collaboratively with other developers.

At Blackbaud, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Policy applies to Blackbaudâs collection and use of personal data in connection with our marketing and provision of the Blackbaud Solutions, customer support and other services (collectively, the âServicesâ), for example if you are a customer, visit the website, interact with us at industry conferences, or work for a current or prospective customer of the Services. In addition, our service Target AnalyticsÂ® collects data on individuals in the United States to provide non-profit customers with accurate information on their prospective constituents in the Social Good space. You can read more about our privacy practices for Target AnalyticsÂ® below. The Services donât include JustGiving, which has its own privacy policy. The terms âpersonal dataâ or âpersonal informationâ refer to information that can reasonably identify an individual.
If youâre a constituent, supporter, patient, or student of one of our customers to which we provide the Services, your data will be used in accordance with that customerâs privacy policy. You can read more about this at https://kb.blackbaud.com/knowledgebase/articles/Article/200862. In providing the Services, Blackbaud acts as a service provider and thus, this Policy will not apply to constituents of our customers.
We collect personal data that you provide to us, either by creating a Blackbaud account, using the website, submitting âContact Usâ forms, or otherwise interacting with us (like at conferences and trade shows). Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register for a Blackbaud ID, subscribe to e-mail newsletters, complete an online form, download resource information, or when requesting information about or purchasing our Services.
We may collect data about you from third parties. As is typical for businesses that market their products to other organizations, sometimes we obtain your work contact information from third party data suppliers or joint marketing partners to contact you with communications containing promotions, customer stories, Blackbaud news and updates or thought leadership. We may also get your information from publicly-available sources and social networking sites, like LinkedIn or your organizationâs website. Blackbaud collects data in the following categories:
In addition to the purposes described when we collect data from you, we may use your personal information in the following ways:
Blackbaud may share your personal information as necessary to provide the Services or as you specifically request. We may disclose your data to our affiliated organizations and subsidiaries, and to service providers who render services to us or you on our behalf. We also may disclose your information if required by law or to enforce our legal rights or defend us against a legal claim or for the identification or remediation of suspected or actual fraudulent activity or security incidents. We may share your information in connection with a sale or reorganization of Blackbaud. We may also share your personal data if it is necessary to act in urgent circumstances to protect the safety of Blackbaud customers, website visitors, or the public.
Except as described below for Target AnalyticsÂ®, Blackbaud doesnât sell any of your personal information, or share your personal information with any third parties for targeted behavioral advertising. We also donât collect, use, or disclose any sensitive personal information, as defined under applicable state or federal law.
Information about opting out of the sale or sharing of your personal information can be found below and at
https://www.blackbaud.com/company/Data-Subject-Rights-Request.
If you are a registered user of our website, you may review and update this information at any time on www.blackbaud.com. Registered users can view and edit personal information they have already given us.
Blackbaudâs websites are general audience sites, and we do not knowingly collect information about children or sell products to children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to assist you in using our website. Furthermore, we may restrict entries to any contests, sweepstakes or promotions to entrants who are at least 18 years of age. We certainly donât sell data of children under 16.
We restrict access to personal information collected about you at our website to our employees, our affiliatesâ employees, those who are otherwise specified in this Policy or others who need to know that information to provide the Services to you or in the course of conducting our business operations or activities. While no website can guarantee exhaustive security, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information collected via the website. We protect our databases with various physical, technical and procedural measures and we restrict access to your information by unauthorized persons. We also advise all Blackbaud employees about their responsibility to protect customer data and we provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to our companyâs business ethics standards and confidentiality policies. Inside Blackbaud, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.

Our website detects and honors the Global Privacy Control signal in accordance with applicable privacy laws. The Global Privacy Control is a signal that can be enabled in certain browsers or browser extensions.
On our website, you may wish to participate in contests, sweepstakes and other promotions that we may offer from time to time. Through these promotions, you may choose to participate in activities such as sharing information found on our websites with others and sending email invitations. If you choose to participate in these promotions, and are eligible to do so, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, date of birth and telephone number.
In connection with any contests, sweepstakes and other promotions that we may offer from time to time via the website, we use the information you provide to administer the contests, sweepstakes and other promotions. We also may use the information to communicate with you, or the other people you select, about our products and services or our partners may use such information to communicate with you about the contests, sweepstakes or other promotions or their products and services. As mentioned above, if you create a profile and submit an entry in connection with a contest or promotion, your name, profile and entry, but not your email address, phone number and age, will be visible to other website users.

For Target AnalyticsÂ®, we collect the following categories of personal information:
We collect this data for business purposes of internal research, internal operations, auditing, detecting security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, fulfilling and improving our Services, quality control, and legal compliance.

Consumer Privacy Rights Requests
Five states afford consumers in those states additional privacy protections. These states are:
The additional privacy protections provided by those laws include: the right to know what information we collect, disclose, and sell; the right to access a copy of your data; the right to request deletion or correction of your data; and the right to opt out of the sale of your data or the sharing of your data for purposes of targeted behavioral advertising. Businesses canât discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.
In the sections above titled âCollection and Use of Personal Informationâ and âTarget AnalyticsÂ®,â we have included descriptions of: the data we collect; the categories of sources of such information; Â the purposes for which we use, sell, share, and disclose the data; the types of data we sell and the categories of third parties to whom the data is sold; and the disclosure of data to third parties for business purposes.
Blackbaud does not sell your personal information, except as set forth in the âTarget AnalyticsÂ®â section.
To exercise any of your privacy rights, please see our Data Subject Rights Requests page at https://www.blackbaud.com/company/Data-Subject-Rights-Request, or call our toll-free number at +1 844-532-0022. We will verify your identity where required prior to fulfilling your request, which may require government identification. Authorized agents may be used to submit rights requests, in which cases we will take steps to verify the consumerâs identity and that the agent has authority to act on the consumerâs behalf.
Blackbaud will maintain and use de-identified data only in a de-identified form and not attempt to re-identify de-identified data.
For questions about this Policy or our privacy practices, or to appeal a decision weâve made regarding your privacy rights where applicable, please email privacy@blackbaud.com.

Like many other colleges, Virginia Tech has an extensive
network of steam tunnels that run beneath much of the campus. These tunnels
carry steam, electricity, and telecommunications lines throughout the campus
and support Tech's population of over 30,000 students and 1000 faculty. Although
these people pass by the grates and manholes that lead to the tunnels every
day, few realize what lies beneath.
The steam pipes in the tunnels originate at the power plant in the corner
of campus and connect to most of the buildings on campus. Water at the plant is
heated into steam by either coal or natural gas and then used to turn a turbine
to generate electricity. The steam then travels to each building, where it is
used for heating, cooking, sterilizing, autoclaving, and more.
While it's possible to directly bury steam lines, this can create problems
when repairs to the steam lines need to be made and also mean that the lines
cannot be upgraded as easily. While there are some direct-buried steam lines
at Virginia Tech, most of the steam lines run through tunnels, which allow
for easy repairs and upgrades. The tunnels also make it easy to run things
like electric lines and telecommunications cables throughout the campus
without digging up anything.
I'm sure it's not even necessary to mention that people have been exploring
Virginia Tech's steam tunnels since they were built. This doesn't mean that
you should, though. While most of the entrances are kept unlocked, many of
them are in plain view. All of the tunnels have posted "No Trespassing" signs,
which makes it a Class 1 misdemeanor in Virginia to enter them. It's also
against university policy, although the tunnels are not specifically
mentioned.
The steam tunnels are also dangerous. Since the steam pipes carry steam,
they get very hot, so you can be burned quite easily. They could even burst,
which would most likely kill you. If that's not enough, some sections of
tunnel, particularly older sections, have asbestos insulation, which can
cause all sorts of lung problems. In short, do not attempt to enter
the steam tunnels.

transferring money to a prepaid card. With this card you can enjoy all 
the possibilities of use (shopping in stores and withdrawals) along with
 peace of mind

cooperate with agents in other cities, because they can be the police. 
It is easier and safer for us to deal with the sale. We also believe in 
Bitcoin and hope to get rich with it.

1. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement
IF YOU OR WE HAVE ANY DISPUTE WITH OR CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER (A âCLAIMâ) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS, AND THE CLAIM IS NOT RESOLVED BY CALLING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT (888) 274-5343 AND BY FOLLOWING THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH BELOW, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE SUCH DISPUTES THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION OR AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and a Claim may not be consolidated with any other personâs claim. You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. You and we agree that any arbitrations between you and us will be subject to this Section 1 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with us. This Section 1 shall survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to any of the Services.
1.1 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure
Before a party commences an arbitration or files a small claims court action with respect to a Claim, the party must first send to the other a written notice of dispute (âNoticeâ). A Notice from you to us must (1) be sent by certified mail; (2) be addressed to: CBS Interactive Inc., 680 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Legal Department (the âNotice Addressâ); (3) contain your name, address, and email address; (4) describe the nature and basis of your Claim; (5) if you are submitting the Notice, include any relevant facts regarding your use of the Services, including without limitation whether you have created an account; (6) specify the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation of them; and (7) include a personally signed statement from you (and not your counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other personâs dispute.
After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).
Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 1.1. All of the requirements of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure are essential so that you and we have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If the arbitration is already pending prior to the completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Information Dispute Resolution Procedure, the arbitration shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in arbitration.
1.2 Arbitration Procedure
Any such arbitration shall be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (âNAMâ) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (âNAM Rulesâ), as modified by this Section 1 (the âArbitration Agreementâ), and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. Â§5.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.NAMADR.com, by calling NAM, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM.
You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure requirements referenced in Section 1.1 and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).
All issues, including the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, are for the arbitrator to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitratorâs decision is binding only between you and us and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitratorâs award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
As in court, you and we agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.
Except as expressly provided in this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneysâ fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law.
In circumstances in which the NAM Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in New York, New York. If the Mass Filing process described in Section 1.7 is triggered, then the location of any hearing will be determined by the arbitrator.
1.3 Discovery During Arbitration
The parties shall each be limited to a maximum of one (1) fact witness deposition per side, unless the arbitrator determines that more depositions are warranted based on the totality of circumstances, including the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests, and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery. Document requests shall be limited to documents that are directly relevant to the matter(s) in dispute or to its outcome; shall be reasonably restricted in terms of time frame, subject matter and persons or entities to which the requests pertain; shall not include broad phraseology such as âall documents directly or indirectly related toâ; and shall not be encumbered with extensive âdefinitionsâ or âinstructions.â The Arbitrator may edit or limit the number of document requests based on the totality of circumstances, including the factors listed above.
Electronic discovery, if any, shall be limited as follows. Absent a showing of compelling need: (i) electronic documents shall only be produced from sources used in the ordinary course of business, and not from backup servers, tapes or other media; (ii) the production of electronic documents shall normally be made on the basis of generally available technology in a searchable format that is usable by the requesting party and convenient and economical for the producing party; (iii) the parties need not produce metadata, with the exception of header fields for email correspondence; (iv) the description of custodians from whom electronic documents may be collected should be narrowly tailored to include only those individuals whose electronic documents may reasonably be expected to contain evidence that is material to the dispute; and (v) where the costs and burdens of e-discovery are disproportionate to the nature of the dispute or to the amount in controversy, or to the relevance of the materials requested, the arbitrator may either deny such requests or order disclosure on the condition that the requesting party advance the reasonable cost of production to the other side, subject to the allocation of costs in the final award.
1.4 Confidentiality
Upon either partyâs request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.
1.5 Offer of Settlement
In any arbitration between you and us, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other partyâs favor and is less than the defending partyâs settlement offer or if the award is in the defending partyâs favor, the other party must pay the defending partyâs costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorneyâs fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.
1.6 Mass Filing
If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (âMass Filingâ) set forth in NAMâs Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (âNAMâs Mass Filing Rules,â available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 1.1, until your Claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration.
Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for CBS Interactive shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and CBS Interactive shall pay the mediatorâs fee.
Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for CBS Interactive shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and CBS Interactive shall pay the mediatorâs fee.
Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for CBS Interactive shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge.
If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:
Option One: You and CBS Interactive may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with these Terms. You may opt out of arbitration by sending CBS Interactive your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by certified mail addressed to CBS Interactive Inc., 680 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Legal Department. Such an opt out notice must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation associated with Stage 3. CBS Interactive may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30-day opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.
OR
Option Two: If neither you nor CBS Interactive elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator, as that term is used in the NAM Rules) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.
A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your Claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your Claim, then your Claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these Terms.
You and CBS Interactive agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and CBS Interactive acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.
1.7 Severability
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The other portions of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.
2. Additional Terms
Additional terms may apply to your use of certain Services. We will provide these terms to you or post them on the Services to which they apply, and they are incorporated by reference into these Terms. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms that apply to a particular Service, the additional terms will control.
Sweepstakes, contests, and promotions on the Services may also have additional rules and eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic restrictions. You are responsible for complying with these rules and requirements.

These fees are not charged by us, and you should contact your wireless provider before you sign up for Mobile Features to determine what fees, if any, will be charged. In addition, you agree that we may arrange for Mobile Features billing through your wireless provider and that your wireless provider may invoice you for the applicable fees or deduct them from your pre-paid balance.
You may not transfer or copy any Content from the wireless device on which you originally received Content to any other device, including, without limitation, any computer or another wireless device.
To cancel a Mobile Feature that involves a subscription fee, you must follow the instructions included in the terms and conditions applicable to that Mobile Feature; otherwise, you will continue to incur subscription charges.

12. Unsolicited Submissions.
We do not accept unsolicited submissions, including scripts, story lines, articles, fan fiction, characters, drawings, suggestions, ideas or concepts.

CBS Interactive retains the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any claim subject to indemnification, and in such cases you agree to cooperate with us to defend such claim. You may not settle any claim covered by this Section 13 without CBS Interactiveâs prior written approval.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIESâ ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, ARE NOT IRREPARABLE AND ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF RESTRICTING OPERATION OF THE SERVICES OR ANY OTHER SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, PROGRAM, TELEVISION SHOW, MOTION PICTURE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE CBS INTERACTIVE PARTIES.
15. Governing Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — More than 1,500 school buildings that were shut for a day after an emailed threat will reopen Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Mayor Eric Garcetti said the FBI has concluded it was not a credible threat.
An "electronic threat" that prompted the unprecedented closure of all of the district's campuses Tuesday is believed to have been "a hoax or something designed to disrupt school districts in large cities," according to Rep. Adam Schiff, a ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
Police Chief Charlie Beck and Sheriff Jim McDonnell said patrols will be stepped up around the school campuses to help alleviate any anxiety among students and parents. The LAUSD also plans to have crisis counselors available on campuses.
"We invite all of our families, all of our kids, all of our teachers back into the LAUSD public schools tomorrow in the hope that we will never ever have to have another day like today," LAUSD Board of Education President Steve Zimmer said.
Beck said the threat, which made reference to bombs, assault rifles and other weapons, was emailed to some school board members late Monday and was routed through Frankfurt, Germany. 
LAUSD is the second-largest school district in the nation, serving more than 655,000 students. The closure affected more than 900 campuses, plus about 200 charter schools and dozens of educational centers.
Zimmer said more than 1,500 educational sites were searched. Some Catholic schools run by the Los Angeles Archdiocese were also shut down because of their proximity to LAUSD campuses.
Superintendent Ramon Cortines said he made the unprecedented decision to close all school campuses out of an abundance of caution, saying that "based on past circumstances, I could not take the chance." He referenced the Dec. 2 terror shooting in San Bernardino as being behind his decision.
The closure cost the school district $29 million. But Beck said Cortines made the right call. "Would you have sent your child to school? Every parent I've asked has said no, of course not."
Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Sherman Oaks, said he reviewed the threat and says the author "claims to be an extremist Muslim who has teamed up with local jihadists. We do not know whether these claims are true or a lie. We do not know whether this email is from a devout Muslim who supports jihadists or perhaps a non-Muslim with a different agenda," Sherman said.
He said the email referenced bombs or possible nerve agents and suggested there were about 32 people involved in possibly planting the devices. But "the text of the email does not demonstrate that the author has studied Islam or has any particular understanding of Islam," Sherman said.
The threat against LAUSD comes a day after a bomb threat against San Bernardino Valley College. It was later determined to be a hoax also.
New York City officials say they received the same threat that led to the closure of LAUSD schools but quickly concluded that it was a hoax.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday morning that he was "absolutely convinced" there was no danger to schoolchildren in New York, and former LAPD chief and current New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said he thought Los Angeles officials overreacted by deciding to close the nation's second-largest school district.
Bratton said the person who wrote the email claimed to be a jihadist but made errors, indicating that the individual is a prankster.
"It is very easy in hindsight to criticize a decision based on results that the decider could never have known. It is also very easy to criticize when you have no responsibility on the outcome of that decision," Beck said.

Did the #LAUSD make the right decision to close all campuses in response to what it believed was an email threat?

"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."

FÃRMULA SE REPITE: SE TOMAN CASAS Y LAS OCUPAN COMO BASE DE OPERACIONES
22-02-2024
Por BenjamÃ­n MartÃ­nez y MartÃ­n Neut
Al menos cuatro casas que han sido allanadas y desalojadas en el barrio de Santiago poniente, comparten una caracterÃ­stica: fueron tomadas y usadas por bandas del crimen organizado para orquestar sus negocios ilÃ­citos, como narcotrÃ¡fico, extorsiÃ³n, explotaciÃ³n sexual, trÃ¡fico de armas y eventos clandestinos. Los dueÃ±os de las casas tambiÃ©n coinciden en sus respuestas: tuvieron miedo y cedieron el uso. Una mujer que arrendaba una pieza en una de ellas fue asesinada de un disparo en la cabeza en 2023, a pocas cuadras de la residencia del Presidente Gabriel Boric. Las bandas, de origen peruano y colombiano, estÃ¡n siendo enfrentadas por la Mesa JurÃ­dico Policial que ya consiguiÃ³ desalojar varias viviendas. Es una batalla en desarrollo.

PROCESO SE RETRASÃ PORQUE UN FUNCIONARIO PRESENTÃ INFORME PLAGIADO
Por Catalina Olate, SofÃ­a FarÃ­as, Antonia San MartÃ­n, Steffanny Guajardo y NicolÃ¡s SepÃºlveda
                   En octubre de 2022 la direcciÃ³n del Senapred oficiÃ³ a los municipios para que elaboraran planes comunales de emergencia. Pero, 15 meses despuÃ©s la Municipalidad de ViÃ±a del Mar no lo tenÃ­a vigente. En noviembre del aÃ±o pasado entregÃ³ una primera versiÃ³n, pero fue desechada porque estaba plagiada. Se iniciÃ³ un sumario contra el funcionario responsable y comenzaron el trabajo de nuevo. Tampoco estaba vigente el plan de evacuaciÃ³n ante incendios. El no saber hacia dÃ³nde escapar, ha sido uno de los principales reclamos de los afectados. A fines de 2021 la Conaf le recomendÃ³ al municipio elaborar ese plan. Pero no estuvo listo cuando se necesitÃ³.

ESPECIALISTAS RASTREARON AL GRUPO QUE OFRECÃA HASTA TUTORIALES PARA COMETER LOS FRAUDES
Por BenjamÃ­n Miranda
                   Dos expertos en ciberseguridad investigaron quÃ© hay detrÃ¡s de la extendida estafa telefÃ³nica que, simulando la entrega de un paquete, busca extraer datos de tarjetas bancarias. Luego de rastrear decenas de nÃºmeros que enviaban esos mensajes y las URL que aparecen en ellos, descubrieron una verdadera comunidad dedicada a perfeccionar las estafas por mensajerÃ­a y un canal de Telegram chino que vende kits con instrucciones para llevar a cabo este delito. Los hallazgos fueron denunciados al Equipo de Respuesta ante Incidentes de Seguridad InformÃ¡tica (CSIRT), dependiente del Ministerio del Interior.

Poco antes de que el Vaticano condenara a Fernando Karadima por abusos sexuales, dos obispos chilenos viajaron hasta Roma para reunirse con el ex secretario de Estado vaticano, Angelo Sodano, uno de los hombres mÃ¡s poderosos de la curia.

A detailed examination of interior routing protocols -- completely updated in a new edition A complete revision of the best-selling first edition--widely considered a premier text on TCP/IP routing protocolsA core textbook for CCIE preparation and a practical reference for network designers, administrators, and engineersIncludes configuration and troubleshooting lessons that would cost thousands to learn in a classroom and numerous real-world examples and case studies Praised in its first edition for its approachable style and wealth of information, this new edition provides readers a deep understanding of IP routing protocols, teaches how to implement these protocols using Cisco routers, and brings readers up to date protocol and implementation enhancements. Routing TCP/IP, Volume 1, Second Edition, includes protocol changes and Cisco features that enhance routing integrity, secure routers from attacks initiated through routing protocols, and provide greater control over the propagation of routing information for all the IP interior routing protocols. Routing TCP/IP, Volume 1, Second Edition, provides a detailed analysis of each of the IP interior gateway protocols (IGPs). Its structure remains the same as the best-selling first edition, though information within each section is enhanced and modified to include the new developments in routing protocols and Cisco implementations. What's New In This Edition? The first edition covers routing protocols as they existed in 1998. The new book updates all covered routing protocols and discusses new features integrated in the latest version of Cisco IOS Software. IPv6, its use with interior routing protocols, and its interoperability and integration with IPv4 are also integrated into this book. Approximately 200 pages of new information are added to the main text, with some old text removed. Additional exercise and solutions are also included.

This advice applies to England.

See advice for
See advice for Northern Ireland, See advice for Scotland, See advice for Wales


Call our consumer helpline on 0808 223 1133.
Lines are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm. Lines are closed on bank holidays.
Calls from mobiles and landlines are free.
Check the different ways to contact the Citizens Advice consumer helpline.
You might be able to get help if youâre struggling to afford your energy bills or top up your prepayment meter.Â The help you get depends on:
how you pay for your energy
the type of energy you use
if you claim benefits
Some scammers are pretending to be from energy companies to get your personal information.
If you think something might be a scam:Â 
donât give out any personal information or bank details
donât use any contact details from the possible scam
You can check if something is a scam.
If you can't afford to top up your prepayment meter, you might be able to get a fuel voucher.
You'll get the voucher as a code in a letter, text message or email.
You can use it to add credit to your gas card or electricity key. If you don't have one of these, contact your supplier to get one.
Your local council might be able to help you get a fuel voucher -Â find your local council on GOV.UK. If youâre still not sure if you can get a voucher,Â get help from an adviser.
You can use a fuel voucher at:
a shop signed up to PayPoint -Â find a shop near you on the PayPoint website
a Post Office or shop signed up to Payzone -Â find a Post Office or shop near you on the Payzone website
To use your voucher youâll need to take:
the code and instructions
some form of ID - for example, your passport or a bill with your name and address
If you have a smart prepayment meter you can also add the fuel voucher credit to your account online. To do this, follow the instructions on your voucher.
Check your fuel voucher to see when it expires. You might have to use it within 15 days.
If you have problems using your voucher, contact the organisation that gave it to you - you should be able to find their contact information on the instructions.
If you canât afford to buy fuel, you might be able to get financial help. You might be eligible if you:
rely on oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal or wood as your main source of heating
arenât on the gas grid
Youâll need to show that you can't heat your home because you can't afford to buy fuel - or you might not be able to afford it soon.
Talk to an adviserÂ if you need help. Your local Citizens Advice will need to apply for you.
Check what other help you can get if you use alternative fuels.
You can get extra help from your gas and electricity supplier by signing up to the Priority Services Register. You can sign up if youâre either:
of State Pension age
disabled or have a long-term health condition
considered âvulnerableâ by your energy network
You could be classed as vulnerable if you're disabled or have a long-term health condition. Your energy network might also consider you vulnerable if you:
don't speak or read English well
have children under 5 years old or are pregnant
have no sense of smell or would struggle to smell gas
Check if you're eligible to sign up to the Priority Services Register.
If youâre on the Priority Services Register your energy supplier can:
make your call a priority when you contact them
give their engineers a password if they visit or contact you - so you know theyâre genuine
move your prepayment meter if you struggle to get to it
Youâll need to fill out the form on your electricity operatorâs website - this is who owns and operates the electricity cables in your area. Your electricity operator is different from your electricity supplier, who sends your bills.
You can check who your electricity network operator is on the Power Cut 105 website. You'll need to know the postcode of your property.Â 
If your landlord gets a discount on energy from a government scheme, they must pass on a fair amount of the discount to you.
You canÂ check how your landlord should pass on energy discounts and how to challenge them if they donât.
Heat network suppliers must pass on a fair amount of any discount they get from the governmentâs Energy Bill Relief Scheme to you.
You canÂ check how to get a discount on your energy if youâre part of a heat network.
If youâre behind with your energy bills, you might be able to get a grant to help you pay off your debt. This might be from your energy company or a charitable trust.
Check which grants you can apply for.
You might be able to get help with the cost of things like insulation, a new boiler or improvements to your heating.
Check if you can get help making energy-saving improvements to your home.
You might be able to find grants or schemes run by your local council. You can try searching on your local councilâs website for energy grants.Â Find your local council's website on GOV.UK.
You might be able to earn rewards this winter for using less electricity at certain times. This is through a scheme called the Demand Flexibility Service, which is running from November 2023 to March 2024.Â 
Youâll need to have a smart meter in your home or have a business account with half-hourly meter readings to be eligible for the scheme.
If youâre eligible and your supplier is part of the scheme, they should be in touch to tell you how to sign up. You can also use some apps to take part without involving your supplier.Â 
Check if your supplier and which apps are part of the Demand Flexibility Service on the National Grid website. 
Your supplier or app provider will contact you before each event to let you know when you should use less electricity. The events generally last an hour and run at the peak time for energy use, between 4pm and 7pm.Â 
At the times your supplier asks you to use less electricity, you should avoid using the appliances that use the most energy, including:
tumble dryer
dishwasher
washing machine
electric shower
electric oven
Donât stop using essential appliances like your fridge freezer or heating. Itâs very important to stay warm and healthy. Thereâs no need to turn your lights off either - lightbulbs donât use much electricity.
You canÂ use our calculator to compare how much power different electrical appliances use.
To stay safe, donât set appliances to run when you are in bed or out of the house.
You canÂ find out more about the Demand Flexibility Service on the National Grid website.
If you get benefits, you might be able to get Â£150 off your electricity bill or Â£150 added to your prepayment meter. Youâll get the payment by the end of March 2024. You donât need to apply for the scheme - payments are automatic. 
You should get the Warm Home Discount if you or your partner got the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit on 13 August 2023.
You might also be able to get the Warm Home Discount if you get a different benefit and the government decides you have 'high energy costs'. This is based on the type of property you live in, not how much you spend. They'll work this out automatically - you don't need to contact them.
If you have high energy costs, youâll get the Warm Home Discount if you or your partner got any of the following benefits on 13 August 2023:
Universal Credit
Pension Credit Savings Credit
Housing Benefit
income-based Jobseekerâs Allowance
income-related Employment and Support Allowance
Income Support
Child Tax Credits and Working Tax Credits - and your income is below the limit that applies to your householdÂ 
The limits are for your gross income per year. This means the total amount before any tax and deductions are taken off. The limits donât include income from:
Child Tax CreditÂ 
Working Tax Credit
Disability Living Allowance
Personal Independence Payment
Attendance Allowance
The government works out your income from your tax credit records.
Youâll only get the Warm Home Discount if your supplier is part of the scheme.Â Check if your supplier is part of the Warm Home Discount Scheme on GOV.UK.
If you're eligible for the winter 2023 to 2024 payment the government will send you a letter between mid-October 2023 and mid-January 2024.Â 
They might ask you for more information to check whether you're eligible. You must tell them by 29 February 2024 - this is when the scheme closes. If you send it by post make sure it gets there in plenty of time.Â 
Check if you're eligible for the Warm Home Discount on GOV.UK.
Check the supplier you were with on 13 August 2023. If you were eligible to get the discount from them, you should still get it. Contact your old supplier and:
ask if they have your contact details
check when the payment will be made
If your supplier on 13 August 2023 isn't in the scheme, you wonât get the discount. This is true even if you switched to a supplier in the scheme after this date.
Check if the supplier you were with is part of the Warm Home Discount Scheme.
You might be able to get the Â£150 discount as part of the Park Homes Warm Home Discount Scheme. To get the discount you must:
permanently live on a park home site
pay for your electricity through the park, or as part of their pitch fees
You must also meet a rule about your household income.Â 
You are eligible if you or somebody you live with get any of the following benefits:
Pension Credit
Income Support
Income-based Jobseekerâs Allowance
Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
Universal Credit - and your income is below Â£1,562 per month
Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit - and your income is below Â£18,723 per year
Housing Benefit or housing element of Universal Credit
Youâre also eligible if your household income is below Â£18,723 per year before any tax or other deductions are taken off.
You should apply for the Park Homes Warm Home Discount Scheme as soon as possible. Thereâs limited funding and the applications will be dealt with in the order they're received.
Apply for  the Park Homes Warm Home Discount Scheme on the Charis website.

You can usually get a Winter Fuel Payment, this is an annual one-off payment to help you pay for heating during the winter.
You can check your State Pension age on GOV.UK.
Youâll get between Â£250 to Â£600, this automatically includes an extra Pensioner Cost of Living Payment.
You should start getting the Winter Fuel Payment automatically once you reach State Pension age, but sometimes you might need to apply. You can checkÂ how to apply for the Winter Fuel Payment on GOV.UK.
Youâll get Â£300 if you live either:
on your own
with people who donât qualify for a Winter Fuel Payment
If you live with someone else who qualifies for the Winter Fuel Payment, the amount youâll get depends on whether either of you gets any of the following:
Pension Credit
income-related ESA
income-based JSA
If either you or the person you live with gets one of these benefits, youâll both get Â£300 - as long as youâre not partners. If youâre partners, youâll only get one Â£300 payment.
If neither of you gets one of these benefits, youâll both get Â£150.
If you live in residential care and qualify for the Winter Fuel Payment, you'll get Â£150 unless you get any of these benefits. If you get any of the benefits, you won't get a pensioner cost of living payment.
If you get certain benefits you might get a Cold Weather Payment when it's very cold. This is a one-off payment to help pay for extra heating costs.
Youâll getÂ Cold Weather Payments between 1 November and 31 March. You'll get a paymentÂ each time the average temperature in your area drops below zero degrees Celsius for 7 days in a row.
Youâll only be eligible for a Cold Weather Payment if you already get:
Pension Credit
Income Support
income-based Jobseekerâs Allowance
income-related Employment and Support Allowance
Universal Credit
support for mortgage interest
If you're eligible, you'll get paid automatically. Check if you can get aÂ Cold Weather PaymentÂ on GOV.UK.
If you use an oxygen concentrator for a disability or health condition, you can get money back for the electricity it uses. This is called a ârebateâ.
You should get the rebate every 3 months. The person who installs your concentrator should tell you how to get the rebate.
If your rebate hasnât been set up, contact the supplier of your concentrator. Your supplier depends on where you live. If you live in:
London or the South West,Â contact Air Liquide Healthcare on their website
the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, or the West Midlands,Â contact Baywater Healthcare on their website
the East of England or East Midlands,Â contact BOC Home Oxygen Service on their website
the North East or the South East,Â contact Dolby Vivisol Home Respiratory Care on their website
You can ask your local council if they have information about nearby âwarm spacesâ. These are public places that anyone can use to stay warm - for example a community space like a library.
You can find out how to contact your local council on GOV.UK.
If youâre struggling with money, there are things you can do to save on your regular living costs. Check what to do if you need help with living costs.

A restoration effort using the Cardano blockchain reached its first goal of planting over 1 million trees, the Cardano Foundation, a non-profit that oversees developments on the Cardano network, said over the weekend.
âThe Cardano Forest is 100% funded, weâve reached the 1 million trees milestone. All trees planted will be recorded on the Cardano blockchain for enhanced transparency and serve as public proof of land restoration activities,â Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard said in a tweet thread.
The foundation has partnered with crypto startup Veritree for the planting effort. Veritree uses blockchain technology to record the supply chain of tree plantations for its users, allowing for a verifiable tracking of such activities.
Veritree plants a tree each time Cardanoâs ADA currency is exchanged for a TREE token. TREE, in turn, can be redeemed for digital trees and non-fungible tokens (NFT) during certain âredemption days,â with the rarity of the issued NFTs based on the initial amount of ADA exchanged.
NFTs are digital assets that can represent ownership of unique tangible and intangible items on a blockchain.
Transactional data shows large amounts of ADA were bestowed towards the effort. One wallet exchanged 100,000 ADA for 100,000 TREE tokens â worth over $118,000 at the time of writing â to become the biggest donor for the cause. Other large donors exchanged amounts ranging from 5,000 ADA (â$5,900 at press time) to 87,500 ADA (â$103,900 at press time).
The Cardano Forest activity is part of a broader effort by Cardano to become a climate-positive blockchain.
Blockchain technology has been the subject of massive criticism in recent years about the blockchainâs environmental impact. Blockchains run on a global network of users or organizations that use their computing resources â by either staking crypto or running mining rigs â to validate data and process transactions on that network.
Mining, in particular, consists of specialized computing systems that solve millions of calculations each second to âwinâ blocks, using huge amounts of electricity to keep running. Such usage of computing resources is deemed unnecessary by critics, who say the large electricity requirements damage the environment.
Newer blockchains like Cosmos, Terra and Cardano run on a proof-of-stake concept that relies on network âstakersâ who lock up their tokens on public nodes to maintain the blockchain. This is said to be more environmentally friendly than mining.
Planting trees is a step in an environmentally friendly direction. The ethos is simple: The creation of more trees can, in theory, offset the damage done by human activity in other parts of the world.
Cardano Foundation and Veritree did not return requests for comment at press time.

If you enjoy working with numbers and solving puzzles, a career as a data analyst could be a good fit.
Data analysts gather, clean, and study data to help guide business decisions. If youâre considering a career in this in-demand field, here's one path to getting started:

Get a foundational education.
Build your technical skills.
Work on projects with real data.
Develop a portfolio of your work.
Practice presenting your findings.
Get an entry-level data analyst job.
Consider certification or an advanced degree.
Let's take a closer look at each of those seven steps.
You can find data analytics jobs in all sorts of industries, and thereâs more than one path toward securing your first job in this high-demand field. Whether youâre just getting started in the professional world or pivoting to a new career, here are some steps toward becoming a data analyst.
Learn more: What Does a Data Analyst Do? A Career Guide
If youâre new to the world of data analysis, youâll want to start by developing some foundational knowledge in the field. Getting a broad overview of data analytics can help you decide whether this career is a good fit while equipping you with job-ready skills.
It used to be that most entry-level data analyst positions required a bachelorâs degree. While many positions still do require a degree, thatâs beginning to change. While you can develop foundational knowledge and enhance your resume with a degree in math, computer science, or another related field, you can also learn what you need through alternative programs, like professional certificate programs, bootcamps, or self-study courses.
Getting a job in data analysis typically requires having a set of specific technical skills. Whether youâre learning through a degree program, professional certificate, or on your own, these are some essential skills youâll likely need to get hired.

Statistics
R or Python programming
SQL (Structured Query Language)
Data visualization
Data cleaning and preparation
Take a look at some job listings for roles youâd like to apply for, and focus your learning on the specific programming languages or visualization tools listed as requirements.
In addition to these hard skills, hiring managers also look for workplace skills, like solid communication skillsâyou may be asked to present your findings to those without as much technical knowledgeâproblem solving ability, and domain knowledge in the industry youâd like to work.
The best way to learn how to find value in data is to work with it in real world settings. Look for degree programs or courses that include hands-on projects using real data sets. You can also find a variety of free public data sets you can use to design your own projects.Â 
Dig into climate data from the National Centers for Environmental Information, delve deeper into the news with data from BuzzFeed, or come up with solutions to looming challenges on Earth and beyond with NASA open data. These are just a few examples of the data out there. Pick a topic youâre interested in and find some data to practice on.
Tip: For more inspiration, check out Courseraâs library of data analysis Guided Projectsâa series of guided, hands-on experiences you can complete in under two hours.
As you play around with data sets on the internet or complete hands-on assignments in your classes, be sure to save your best work for your portfolio. A portfolio demonstrates your skills to hiring managers. A strong portfolio can go a long way toward getting the job.Â Â 
As you start to curate work for your portfolio, choose projects that demonstrate your ability to:


Scrape data from different sources
Clean and normalize raw data
Visualize your findings through graphs, charts, maps, and other visualizations
Draw actionable insights from data
If youâve worked on any group projects through the course of your learning, consider including one of those as well. This shows that youâre able to work as part of a team.
If youâre not sure what to include in your portfolio (or need some inspiration for project ideas), spend some time browsing through other peopleâs portfolios to see what theyâve chosen to include.
Tip: Sign up for a GitHub account and start posting your projects and code to the site. Itâs an excellent spot to network with a community of data analysts, show off your work, and possibly catch the eye of recruiters.
It can be easy to focus only on the technical aspects of data analysis, but donât neglect your communication skills. A significant element of working as a data analyst is presenting your findings to decision makers and other stakeholders in the company. When youâre able to tell a story with the data, you can help your organization make data-driven decisions.Â 
Data-driven decision-making, sometimes abbreviated to DDDM), can be defined as the process of making strategic business decisions based on facts, data, and metrics instead of intuition, emotion, or observation.
This might sound obvious, but in practice, not all organizations are as data-driven as they could be. According to global management consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute, data-driven companies are better at acquiring new customers, maintaining customer loyalty, and achieving above-average profitability [1].
As you complete projects for your portfolio, practice presenting your findings. Think about what message you want to convey and what visuals youâll use to support your message. Practice speaking slowly and making eye contact. Practice in front of the mirror or your classmates. Try recording yourself as you present so you can watch it back and look for areas to improve.
After gaining some experience working with data and presenting your findings, itâs time to polish your resume and begin applying for entry-level data analysts jobs. Donât be afraid to apply for positions you donât feel 100-percent qualified for. Your skills, portfolio, and enthusiasm for a role can often matter more than if you check every bullet item in the qualifications list.
If youâre still in school, ask your universityâs career services office about any internship opportunities. With an internship, you can start gaining real world experience for your resume and apply what youâre learning on the job.
As you move through your career as a data analyst, consider how youâd like to advance and what other qualifications can help you get there. Certifications, like the Certified Analytics Professional or Cloudera Certified Associate Data Analyst, might help qualify you for more advanced positions at higher pay grades.Â Â 
Tip: Consider pursuing your data science degree online from an accredited university so you can continue working (and earning a paycheck) as you learn.
The University of Michigan School of Informationâs online Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) degree is designed for aspiring data scientists to learn and apply skills through hands-on projects. Youâll learn how to use data to improve outcomes and achieve ambitious goals.
If youâre considering advancing into a role as a data scientist, you may need to earn a masterâs degree in data science or a related field. Advanced degrees are not always required, but having one can open up more opportunities.

In this video, practicing data professionals offer their best advice for aspiring data analysts.

A degree isnât always necessary to get hired as a data analyst. Data analysts are in demand, and employers want to know that you have the skills to do the job. If you donât have a degree, focus on making your portfolio shine with your best work.Â 
If youâre looking to build job-ready data analyst skills without spending the time or money on a degree, consider the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate through Coursera.
Learn how to clean and organize data with SQL and R, visualize with Tableau, and complete a case study for your portfolioâno prior experience or degree required. Upon completion, you can start applying for entry-level jobs directly with Google and more than 130 other US employers.
Often employers will want you to have experience working with data before taking a role as a data analyst. Luckily, you donât have to wait to get hired to start gaining experience. Data is all around us.Â 
If youâre switching to data analysis from another field, start to develop your experience by working with data. Many degree programs, certificate courses, and online classes include hands-on projects with real data sets. You can also find free data sets on the internet (or scrape your own) to gain experience collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real data.






It can take anywhere from several months to several years to become a data analyst. The amount of time it takes you will depend on your current skill set, what type of educational path you choose, and how much time you spend each week developing your data analytics skills.

Yes, though a degree in a relevant field will likely improve your chances. While many positions will list a bachelorâs degree as a job requirement, it is possible to get hired with the right set of skills and experience. If you donât have a degree (or a degree in a related field), be sure to spend extra time developing your portfolio to validate your abilities.â
Demand for skilled data analysts is growing â the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs 2020 report listed this career as number one in terms of increasing demand [2]. And hiring data analysts is a top priority across a range of industries, including technology, financial services, healthcare, information technology, and energy.â
Data analytics is a skill-based profession. Many positions will look for candidates with proficiency in SQL, Microsoft Excel, R or Python programming, data visualization, and presentation skills. Check some job listings in the industry youâre planning to apply to for more specific qualifications.â

These FAQs are designed to provide a better understanding of Creative
Commons, our licenses, and our other legal and technical tools. They provide
basic information, sometimes about fairly complex topics, and will often link
to more detailed information.
Creative Commons does not provide legal advice. This FAQ is for
informational purposes and is not a substitute for legal advice. It may not
cover important issues that affect you. You should consult with your own lawyer
if you have questions.
   
Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and
reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools.
Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of their works by
offering them for use under generous, standardized terms; those who want to
make creative uses of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis.
Our vision is to help others realize the full potential of the internet. CC has
affiliates all over the
world who help ensure our licenses work internationally and who raise
awareness of our work.
Although Creative Commons is best known for its licenses, our work extends
beyond just providing copyright licenses. CC offers other legal and technical
tools that also facilitate sharing and discovery of creative works, such as CC0, a public domain
dedication for rights holders who wish to put their work into the public domain
before the expiration of copyright, and the Public Domain
Mark, a tool for marking a work that is in the worldwide public domain.
Creative Commons licenses and tools were designed specifically to work with the
web, which makes content that is offered under their terms easy to search for,
discover, and use.
For more information about CC, our main website contains in-depth
information about the
organization, its staff and
board of directors, its history, and its supporters. You can also
read CC case studies
to learn about some of the inspiring ways CC licenses and tools have been used
to share works and support innovative business models. You can find regularly
updated information about CC by visiting the blog.
Absolutely not. CC has responded to claims to
the contrary. CC licenses are copyright licenses, and depend on the
existence of copyright to work. CC licenses are legal tools that creators and
other rights holders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while
reserving other rights. Those who want to make their work available to the
public for limited kinds of uses while preserving their copyright may want to
consider using CC licenses. Others who want to reserve all of their rights
under copyright law should not use CC licenses.
That said, Creative Commons recognizes the need for change in copyright law,
and many members of the Creative Commons community are active participants in
the copyright reform movement. For more information, see our statement in support of
copyright reform.
Copyright grants to
creators a bundle of exclusive rights over their creative works, which
generally include, at a minimum, the right to reproduce, distribute, display,
and make adaptations. The phrase “All Rights Reserved” is often used by owners
to indicate that they reserve all of the rights granted to them under the law.
When copyright expires, the work enters the public domain, and the
rights holder can no longer stop others from engaging in those activities under
copyright, with the exception of moral rights reserved to creators in some
jurisdictions. Creative Commons licenses offer creators a spectrum of choices
between retaining all rights and relinquishing all rights (public domain), an
approach we call “Some Rights Reserved.”
 
No. Creative Commons is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice or
legal services. CC is similar to a self-help service that offers free,
form-based legal documents for others to use. These FAQ answers many of the
most common questions. There is also specialized information available on the
following pages:
While CC does provide this informational guidance about its licenses and
other tools, this information may not apply to your particular situation, and
should never be taken as legal advice.
If you’re looking for legal advice about using CC licenses and other tools,
we recommend contacting the Creative Commons affiliate in your jurisdiction. CC
affiliates are highly connected to the communities of copyright lawyers in
their countries. We also offer a list of lawyers and organizations who have identified
themselves as willing to provide information to others about CC licensing
issues. However, please note that CC does not provide referral services, and
does not endorse or recommend any person on that list.



No, CC does not collect content or track licensed material. However, CC
builds technical tools that help the public search for and use works licensed
under our licenses and other legal tools, and many others have built such tools
as well. CC Search is one tool
developed by CC to help the public discover works offered under Creative
Commons licenses on the internet via CC-aware search engines and
repositories.

The CC buttons are a shorthand way to convey the basic permissions
associated with material offered under CC licenses. Creators and owners who
apply CC licenses to their material can download and apply those
buttons to communicate to users the permissions granted in advance. When
the material is offered online, the buttons should usually link out to the
human-readable license deeds (which, in turn, link to the license itself).




You may download high
resolution versions of the Creative Commons logos and use them in
connection with your work or your website, provided you comply with our policies. Among other things,
if you use the logos on a website or on your work, you may not alter the logos
in any respect—such as by changing the font, the proportions, or the colors.
CC’s buttons, name, and corporate logo (the “CC” in a circle) are trademarks of
Creative Commons. You cannot use them in ways not permitted by our policies
unless you first receive express, written permission. This means, for example,
that you cannot (without our permission) print your own buttons and t-shirts
using CC logos, although you can purchase them in CC’s store.

Please support CC by making a donation through our support page. Donations can be
handled through PayPal or by credit card. You can also support CC by visiting
our store.
CC always welcomes your feedback, which you can provide by emailing info at creativecommons dot org.
You can also participate in CC’s email discussion lists
and share feedback and ideas in one of those forums.
If you are a software developer, sysadmin, or have other technical
expertise, please join
our developer community and help build the tools that build the
commons.
Finally, one of the best ways to support CC is by supporting our causes
yourself. Follow our blog to
find out about current issues where you can help get involved and spread the
word, and advocate for free and open licensing in your own communities.

Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and
reuse of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools, with affiliates all
over the world who help ensure our licenses work internationally and raise
awareness about our work. Our tools are free, and our reach is wide.
In order to…
…we need $ to make it all happen! For more information, please take a look
at our Annual Report.
Creative Commons has always relied on the generosity of both individuals and
organizations to fund its ongoing operations. It is essential we have the
public’s support because it is the creators and users of CC material who make
our tools relevant in this digital age. They depend on the tools and services
CC provides through their reuse and remix of the rich, open resources available
on Wikipedia, Flickr, SoundCloud, Vimeo, Europeana, MIT OpenCourseWare, PLOS, Al
Jazeera, and YouTube—just to name a few.
Many of these people donate $10, $25, or $50 to CC, to help keep it up and
running so we can continue to provide our tools and services for free, as a
nonprofit organization. The more people who donate to CC, the more
independent it will remain.
 
Creative Commons licenses
provide an easy way to manage the copyright terms that attach automatically to
all creative material under copyright. Our licenses
allow that material to be shared and reused under terms that are flexible and
legally sound. Creative Commons offers a core suite of six copyright licenses.
Because there is no single “Creative Commons license,” it is important to
identify which of the six
licenses you are applying to your material, which of the six licenses has
been applied to material that you intend to use, and in both cases the specific
version.
All of our licenses require that users provide attribution (BY) to the
creator when the material is used and shared. Some licensors choose the BY
license, which requires attribution to the creator as the only condition to
reuse of the material. The other five licenses combine BY with one or more of
three additional license elements: NonCommercial (NC), which prohibits
commercial use of the material; NoDerivatives (ND), which prohibits the sharing
of adaptations of the material; and ShareAlike (SA), which requires adaptations
of the material be released under the same license.
CC licenses may be applied to any type of work, including educational
resources, music, photographs, databases, government and public sector information, and many
other types of material. The only categories of works for which CC does not
recommend its licenses are computer
software and hardware. You should also not apply Creative Commons licenses
to works that are no
longer protected by copyright or are otherwise in the public domain.
Instead, for those works in the worldwide public domain, we recommend that you
mark them with the Public
Domain Mark.
CC licenses are operative only when applied to material in which a copyright
exists, and even then only when a particular use would otherwise not be
permitted by copyright. Note that the latest version of CC licenses also
applies to rights similar to copyright, such as neighboring
rights and sui
generis database rights. Learn
more about the scope of the licenses. This means that CC license terms and
conditions are not triggered by uses
permitted under any applicable exceptions and limitations to copyright, nor
do license terms and conditions apply to elements of a licensed work that are
in the public domain. This also means that CC licenses do not contractually
impose restrictions on uses of a work where there is no underlying copyright.
This feature (and others) distinguish
CC licenses from some other open licenses like the ODbL and ODC-BY, both of which are
intended to impose
contractual conditions and restrictions on the reuse of databases in
jurisdictions where there is no underlying copyright or sui generis database
right.
All CC licenses are non-exclusive: creators
and owners can enter into additional, different licensing arrangements for
the same material at any time (often referred to as “dual-licensing” or
“multi-licensing”). However, CC
licenses are not revocable once granted unless there has been a breach, and
even then the license is terminated only for the breaching licensee.
Please note that CC0 is not a license; it is a public domain dedication.
When CC0 is applied to a work, copyright no longer applies to the work in most
jurisdictions around the world. Therefore, references to dual licensing
arrangements like the one above are inapplicable to CC0.
There are also videos and
comics that offer visual descriptions of how CC licenses work.
In November 2013, Creative Commons published the version 4.0 license suite.
These licenses are the most up-to-date licenses offered by CC, and are
recommended over all prior versions. You can see how the licenses have been
improved over time on the license versions
page. 4.0 has been drafted to be internationally valid, and will have
official translations becoming available after publication.

No. By design, CC licenses do not reduce, limit, or restrict any rights
under exceptions and limitations to copyright, such as fair use or fair dealing. If your use
of CC-licensed material would otherwise be allowed because of an applicable
exception or limitation, you do not need to rely on the CC license or comply
with its terms and conditions. This is a
fundamental principle of CC licensing.
Our licenses and legal tools are intended for use by anyone who holds
copyright in the material. This is often, but not always, the creator.
Creative Commons offers licenses and tools to the public free of charge and
does not require that creators or other rights holders register with CC in
order to apply a CC license to a work. This means that CC
does not have special knowledge of who uses the licenses and for what
purposes, nor does CC have a way to contact creators beyond means generally
available to the public. CC has no authority to grant permission on behalf of
those persons, nor does CC manage those rights on behalf of others.
If you would like to obtain additional permissions to use the work beyond
those granted by the license that has been applied, or if you’re not sure if
your intended use is permitted by the license, you should contact
the rights holder.
  
Creative Commons licenses are drafted to be enforceable around the world,
and have been enforced in
court in various jurisdictions. To CC’s knowledge, the licenses have never
been held unenforceable or invalid.
CC licenses contain a “severability” clause. This allows a court to
eliminate any provision determined to be unenforceable, and enforce the
remaining provisions of the license.
CC alerts
prospective licensors they need to have all necessary rights before
applying a CC license to a work. If that is not the case and someone has marked
your work with a CC license without your authorization, you should contact that
person and tell them to remove the license from your work. You may also wish to
contact a lawyer. Creative Commons is not a law firm and cannot represent you
or give you legal advice, but there are lawyers
who have identified themselves as interested in representing people in
CC-related matters.

One of CC’s goals is ensuring that all of its legal tools work globally, so
that anyone anywhere in the world can share their work on globally standard
terms. To this end, CC offers a core suite of six international copyright
licenses (formerly called the “unported”) that are drafted based largely on
various international
treaties governing copyright, taking into account as many
jurisdiction-specific legal issues as possible. The latest version (4.0) has
been drafted with particular attention to the needs of international
enforceability.
For version 3.0 and earlier, Creative Commons has also offered ported
versions of its six core licenses for many jurisdictions (which usually
correspond to countries, but not always). These ported licenses are based on
the international license suite but have been modified to reflect local nuances
in the expression of legal terms and conditions, drafting protocols, and
language. The ported licenses and the international licenses are all intended
to be legally effective everywhere. CC expects that few, if any, ports will be
necessary for 4.0.
CC recommends that you take advantage of the improvements in the 4.0 suite
explained on the license versions
page unless there are particular
considerations you are aware of that would require a ported license.
Yes. Works licensed under CC BY may be incorporated into works that are
licensed under CC BY-SA. For example, you may incorporate a CC BY photograph
into a Wikipedia article so long as you keep all copyright notices intact,
provide proper attribution, and otherwise comply with the terms of CC BY. Learn more about the
licenses.




Yes, anyone may use CC licenses for material they own, including governments
and IGOs, and these institutions frequently use CC licenses on their copyrightable
material. The reasons for doing so vary, and often include a desire to
maximize the impact and utility of works for educational and informational
purposes, and to enhance transparency.
Creative Commons licenses have desirable features that make
them the preferred choice over custom licenses. CC licenses are standard and
interoperable, which means material published by different creators using the
same type of CC license can be translated, modified, compiled, and remixed
without legal barriers depending on the particular
license applied. Creative Commons licenses are also machine-readable,
allowing CC-licensed works to be easily discovered via search engines such as
Google. These features maximize distribution, reuse, and impact of works
published by governments and IGOs.
Though we encourage anyone to use version 4.0, which is internationally
valid and may be used by individuals as well as organizations, there is an IGO
ported version of 3.0 that IGOs may also use. Read more about how governments
and IGOs
use and leverage CC licenses and legal tools, considerations for using our
licenses, and how
they operate in the IGO context.


This issue depends largely on the laws in place where the child lives. In
the United States, children can be copyright holders and are entitled to
license their works in the same manner as adults. However, they may have the
right to disaffirm certain types of legal agreements, including licenses. In
many parts of the United States, for example, children have the ability to
disaffirm some types of agreements under certain circumstances once they reach
the age where they are considered adults within the relevant jurisdiction. We
are unaware of any attempt by a licensor to exercise the disaffirmation right
with respect to a CC license applied to a work.
Official language translations will be available for the 4.0 licenses and
CC0. When you license your own work, you may use or link to the text of any
available official translation. When you reuse CC-licensed material, you may
comply with the license conditions by referring to any available official
translation of the license. These translations are linguistic translations of
the English version which adhere as closely as possible to the original text.
These translations have been done by our affiliates in accordance with the Legal
Code Translation Policy and with the oversight and detailed review of the
CC legal team. Note that these are equivalents of the original English; these
translations are not jurisdiction
ported versions. You may find a list of all available translations here.
For versions 3.0 and earlier, official translations are not available. Some
unofficial translations were made for informational purposes only.
(Jurisdiction ported versions of version 3.0 and earlier were generally
published in the official language(s) of the appropriate jurisdiction. However,
the ported licenses are not
equivalent to the international licenses, and do not serve as substitutable
references for purposes of complying with the terms and conditions of the
licenses.)
A BY-SA Compatible License is a license officially designated by Creative
Commons pursuant to the ShareAlike
compatibility process. Once deemed a BY-SA Compatible License, you may use
the license to publish your contributions to an adaptation of a BY-SA work. To

about ShareAlike compatibility here.

Applying a Creative Commons license to your material is a serious decision.
When you apply a CC license, you give permission to anyone to use your material
for the full duration of applicable copyright and similar rights.
CC has identified some
things that you should consider before you apply a CC license, some of
which relate to your ability to apply a CC license at all. Here are some
highlights:

If you are unsure which license best suits your needs, there are plenty of
resources to help rights holders choose the right CC license. CC Australia has
developed a flow
chart that may be useful in helping you settle on the right license for
your work. You can also read case
studies of others who are using CC licenses. The CC community can also
respond to questions, and may have already addressed issues you raise. The CC
community email discussion
lists and discussion archives may be useful resources.
Finally, you may also want to consult
with a lawyer to obtain advice on the best license for your needs.

The latest version of the Creative Commons licenses is version 4.0. You
should always use the latest version of the Creative Commons licenses in order
to take advantage of the many improvements described on the license
versions page. In particular, 4.0 is meant to be better suited to
international use, and use in many different contexts, including sharing data.

All CC licenses are intended to work worldwide. Unless you have a specific
reason to use a ported
license, we suggest you consider using one of the international licenses.
4.0 will support official translations of the international license for those
who wish to use the licenses in another language.
As of version 4.0, CC is discouraging ported versions, and has placed a hold
on new porting projects following its publication until sometime in 2014. At
that point, CC will reevaluate the necessity of porting in the future.
We recommend that you use a version 4.0 international license. This is the
most up-to-date version of our licenses, drafted after broad consultation with
our global network of affiliates, and it has been written to be internationally
valid. There are currently no ports
of 4.0, and it is planned that few, if any, will be created.
All of the ported licenses are at version 3.0 or earlier, which means
licensors using those licenses do not have the benefit of the improvements made in the 4.0 license
suite. But even before considering the improvements in 4.0, there are
several reasons why the international licenses may be preferable for rights
holders, even if the licenses have been ported to their jurisdiction. As an
organization, CC itself licenses all of its own content under an international
license because, among other reasons, the international licenses are
essentially jurisdiction-neutral while remaining effective globally. The
neutral nature of the international licenses appeals to many people and
organizations, particularly for use in connection with global projects that
transcend political borders. Finally, it is important to know that some of the
ported licenses contain a choice of law provision, which may be undesirable for
your needs.
However, some rights holders still choose a license ported to their local
jurisdiction because they believe their needs are not sufficiently met by the
international licenses. If the licenses have been ported to your jurisdiction
and you feel that the ported licenses better account for some aspect of local
legislation, then you may wish to consider a ported license.
You can use our
jurisdiction database to compare international licenses and ports on these
issues and others, such as whether a ported license contains a choice of law or
forum selection clause.
Licensors are not required to use the CC license chooser or provide
any information about themselves or their material when applying a CC license
to their material. However, using the license chooser enables licensors to take
advantage of the “machine readable” layer of CC licenses. Our machine-readable code
enhances the discoverability of your work because that code allows software,
search engines, and other tools to recognize when something is licensed under a
CC license. The code also facilitates attribution: when users click on the CC
button placed on your site, they will be linked directly to HTML code that they
can cut and paste to provide attribution.
  
For online material: Select the license that is appropriate
for your material from the CC
license chooser and then follow the instructions
to include the HTML code. The code will automatically generate a license
button and a statement that your material is licensed under a CC license.
If you are only licensing part of a work (for example, if you have created a
video under a CC license but are using a song under a different license), be
sure to clearly mark
which parts are under the CC license and which parts are not. The HTML code
will also include metadata, which allows the material to be discovered via Creative Commons-enabled search
engines.
For offline material: Identify which license you wish to
apply to your work and either (a) mark
your work with a statement such as, “This work is licensed under the
Creative Commons [insert description] License. To view a copy of the license,
visit [insert url]”; or (b) insert the applicable license
buttons with the same statement and URL link.
For third-party platforms: Many media
platforms like Flickr, YouTube, and SoundCloud have built-in Creative Commons
capabilities, letting users mark their material with a CC license through their
account settings. The benefit of using this functionality is that it allows
other people to find your content when searching on those platforms for
CC-licensed material. If the platform where you’re uploading your content
does not support CC licensing, you can still identify your content as
CC-licensed in the text description of your content.
Legally, these three options are the same. The only difference between
applying a CC license offline rather than online is that marking a work online
with metadata will ensure that users will be able to find it through CC-enabled
search engines.
CC offers resources on the best
practices for marking your material and on how
to mark material in different media (.pdf).





No. CC offers its licenses, code, and tools to the public free of charge,
without obligation. You do not need to register with Creative Commons to apply
a CC license to your material; it is legally valid as soon as you apply it to
any material you have the legal right to license.
CC does not require or provide any means for creators or other rights
holders to register use of a CC license, nor
does CC maintain a database of works distributed under Creative Commons
licenses. CC also does not require registration of the work with a national
copyright agency.


Although CC licenses get attached to tangible works (such as photos and
novels), the license terms and conditions apply to the licensor’s copyright
in the licensed material. The public is granted “permission to exercise” those
rights in any
medium or format. It is the expression that is protected by copyright and
covered by the licenses, not any particular medium or format in which the
expression is manifested. This means, for example, that a CC license applied
to a digitized copy of a novel grants the public permission under copyright
to use a print version of the same novel on the same terms and conditions
(though you may have to purchase the print version from a bookstore).
We recommend against using Creative Commons licenses for software. Instead,
we strongly encourage you to use one of the very good software licenses which
are already available. We recommend considering licenses
listed as free by the Free Software
Foundation and listed as “open
source” by the Open Source
Initiative.
Unlike software-specific licenses, CC licenses do not contain specific terms
about the distribution of source code, which is often important to ensuring the
free reuse and modifiability of software. Many software licenses also address
patent rights, which are important to software but may not be applicable to
other copyrightable works. Additionally, our licenses are currently not
compatible with the major software licenses, so it would be difficult to
integrate CC-licensed work with other free software. Existing software licenses
were designed specifically for use with software and offer a similar set of
rights to the Creative Commons licenses.
Version 4.0 of CC’s Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA) license is one-way compatible
with the GNU General Public
License version 3.0 (GPLv3). This compatibility mechanism is designed for
situations in which content is integrated into software code in a way that
makes it difficult or impossible to distinguish the two. There are special
considerations required before using this compatibility mechanism. Read more
about it here.
Also, the CC0 Public Domain Dedication is GPL-compatible
and acceptable for software. For details, see
the relevant CC0 FAQ entry.
While we recommend against using a CC license on software itself, CC
licenses may be used for software documentation, as well as for separate
artistic elements such as game art or music.

Yes. CC licenses can
be used on databases. In the 4.0 license suite, applicable sui
generis database rights are licensed under the same license conditions as
copyright. Many governments
and others use CC licenses for data and databases.
For more detailed information about how CC licenses apply to data and
databases, visit our detailed Data FAQ.
Creative Commons does not recommend using a CC license on a logo or
trademark. While a logo or trademark can be covered by copyright laws in
addition to trademark laws, the special purposes of trademarks make CC licenses
an unsuitable mechanism for sharing them in most cases. Generally, logos and
trademarks are used to identify the origin of a product or service, or to
indicate that it meets a specific standard or quality. Allowing anyone to reuse
or modify your logo or trademark as a matter of copyright could result in your
inability to limit use of your logo or trademark selectively to accomplish
those purposes. Applying a CC license to your trademarks and logos could even
result in a loss of your trademark rights altogether. See below
for more about how to license material that includes a trademark or logo.
There are other ways to share your logos and trademarks widely while
preserving your trademark rights. Establishing a trademark policy that grants
permissions in advance for limited uses is one common alternative. Mozilla, Wikimedia, and
Creative Commons have each
published policies that accomplish the dual objectives of encouraging reuse and
preserving trademark rights.


CC licenses should not be applied to works in the worldwide public
domain. All CC licenses are clear that they do
not have the effect of placing restrictions on material that would
otherwise be unrestricted, and you cannot remove a work from the public domain
by applying a CC license to it. If you want to dedicate your own work to the
public domain before the expiration of applicable copyright or similar rights,
use CC’s legally robust public
domain dedication. If a work is already in the worldwide public domain, you
should mark it with CC’s Public
Domain Mark.
Note that, in some cases, a work may be in the public domain under the
copyright laws of some jurisdictions but not others. For example, U.S.
government works are in the public domain under the copyright law of the United
States, but may be protected by copyright laws in other jurisdictions. A CC
license applied to such a work would be effective (and the license restrictions
enforceable) in jurisdictions where copyright protection exists, but would not
be operative if U.S. copyright law is determined to be the applicable law.
Creators may also apply Creative Commons licenses to material they create
that are adapted from public domain works, or to remixed material, databases,
or collections that include work in the public domain. However, in each of
these instances, the license does not affect parts of the work that are
unrestricted by copyright or similar rights. We strongly encourage you to mark
the public domain material, so that others know they are also free to use
this material without legal restriction.

That depends. You can apply a CC license to your photograph if your
photograph constitutes a work of original authorship, a question that varies by
jurisdiction. As a general matter, your photograph must involve some creative
choices, such as background setting, lighting, angle, or other mark of
creativity. In the United States, an exact photographic copy of a public domain
work is not subject to copyright because there is no originality (even if there
is effort or “sweat” exerted in its creation).
In practice, if your photograph is sufficiently creative to attract
copyright protection, people will likely have to comply with the license
conditions if they reproduce your entire photograph in verbatim form, absent
some applicable exception or limitation such as fair use. However, they would not have to comply with the license conditions if
they reproduce only those parts of the work in the public domain. This is
because your copyright in the adaptation only extends to the material you
contributed, not to the underlying work.
Yes, but it is important to prominently mark any third party material you
incorporate into your work so reusers do not think the CC license applies to
that material. The CC license only applies to the rights you have in the work.
For example, if your CC-licensed slide deck includes a Flickr image you are
using pursuant to fair use, make sure to identify that image as not being
subject to the CC license. For more information about incorporating work owned
by others, see our page about marking third party content. Read more considerations for
licensors here.
CC licenses are copyright licenses, but the latest version of CC licenses
also cover certain other rights similar to copyright, including performance, broadcast,
and sound recording rights, as well as sui generis
database rights. You may apply a 4.0 license to material subject to any of
those rights, whether or not the material is also subject to copyright. Note
that the scope of prior versions of CC licenses was more limited. You should
refer to our license versions page for details.
As a general matter, all CC licenses preserve moral rights to the extent
they exist (they do not exist everywhere), but allow uses of the work in ways
contemplated by the license that might otherwise violate moral rights. If you
apply a 4.0 license to your material, you agree to waive or not assert any
moral rights you have, to the limited extent necessary to allow the public to
exercise the licensed rights. This is designed to minimize the effect of moral
rights on licensees’ ability to use the work, and ensure that the license works
internationally as intended. The attribution requirement contained in all of
our licenses is intended to satisfy the moral right of attribution, but it must
be adhered to whether or not the applicable jurisdiction recognizes moral
rights.
Earlier versions of the license are also intended to
minimize the effect of moral rights on otherwise-permitted uses, but the
language in the licenses differs. Additionally, jurisdiction ports of earlier
versions of CC licenses often contain versions of the moral rights language
designed to account for moral rights legislation in a particular jurisdiction.
If you are applying a ported license to your work, you may wish to review the
moral rights language in the particular license.
You can also compare how different jurisdictions have implemented this
provision, or browse the license versions page to compare the treatment
of this issue across the different versions of the CC licenses.

Yes, you may offer material under a Creative Commons license that includes a
trademark indicating the source of the work without affecting rights in the
trademark, because trademark rights are not licensed by the CC licenses.
However, applying the CC license may create an implied license to use the
trademark in connection with the licensed material, although not in ways that
require permission under trademark law. To avoid any uncertainty, Creative
Commons recommends that licensors who wish to mark material with trademarks or
other branding materials give notice to licensees expressly disclaiming
application of the license to those elements. This can be done in the copyright
notice, but could also be noted on the website where the work is published.
The following is an example notice:
“The text of and illustrations in this document are licensed by Red Hat
under a Creative Commons Attribution–Share Alike 3.0 Unported license
(”CC-BY-SA”). . . . Red Hat, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Shadowman logo,
JBoss, MetaMatrix, Fedora, the Infinity Logo, and RHCE are trademarks of Red
Hat, Inc., registered in the United States and other countries. For guidelines
on the permitted uses of the Fedora trademarks, refer to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Trademark_guidelines.”
When you apply the latest version (4.0) of a CC license to your material,
you also agree to waive or not assert any publicity, privacy, or personality rights that you hold in
the material you are licensing, to the limited extent necessary for others to
exercise the licensed rights. For example, if you have licensed a photograph of
yourself, you may not assert your right of privacy to have the photo removed
from further distribution. (Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, this is implied
but not explicit.) If you do not wish to license these rights in this way, you
should not apply a CC license to the material where this is a concern.
If there are any third parties who may have publicity, privacy, or
personality rights that apply, those rights are not affected by your
application of a CC license, and a reuser must seek permission for relevant
uses. If you are aware of any such third party rights in the material you are
licensing, we recommend marking the material to give notice to reusers.
Plagiarism involves the copying of someone else’s creation or ideas and
passing them off as one’s own without attribution to the original author.
Plagiarism is generally a matter of ethics and is dealt with primarily through
social norms, ethics policies, academic standards, and codes of conduct.
Plagiarism will usually give rise to professional or academic sanctions, and
will not necessarily be the subject of legal proceedings.
Copyright infringement is a matter of law and will give rise to legal
sanctions. An action may be considered plagiarism but not copyright
infringement and vice versa, or both at the same time. For example, copying
part of a text and not crediting the author could be considered plagiarism in
an academic context, but not copyright infringement if the reproduction is
allowed under an exception or if the text is in the public domain (subject to
the application of moral rights). Conversely, copying part of a text without
authorization and without benefiting from an exception but with correctly
crediting the author could be copyright infringement but not plagiarism.
Creative Commons licenses are not designed to address issues that fall
outside the scope of copyright law, although, when the licenses were first
developed, Creative Commons expected that the attribution
requirement would contribute to reducing instances of plagiarism. Regardless,
activities such as plagiarism are not directly governed by the application of
CC licenses. That said, the attribution requirement and the obligation to
indicate modifications made to a work can alleviate authors’ concerns over
plagiarism and serve to assist in the enforcement of attribution and citation
in the scholarly and academic contexts.
For more information, read our blog post Why
Sharing Academic Publications Under “No Derivatives” Licenses is
Misguided.

You may license your copyright or distribute your work under more than one
set of terms. For example, you may publish a photograph on your website, but
only distribute high-resolution copies to people who have paid for access. This
is a practice CC supports. However, if the low-resolution and high-resolution
copies are the same work under applicable copyright law, permission under
a CC license is not limited to a particular copy, and someone who receives a
copy in high resolution may use it under the terms of the CC license applied to
the low-resolution copy.
Note that, although CC strongly discourages the practice, CC cannot prevent
licensors from attempting to impose restrictions through separate agreements on
uses the license otherwise would allow. In that case, licensees may be contractually restricted from using the high-resolution
copy, for example, even if the licensor has placed a CC license on the
low-resolution copy.
Creators and other rights holders may wish to check with their collecting society
before applying a CC license to their material. Many rights holders who are
members of a collecting society can waive the right to collect royalties for
uses allowed under the license, but only to the extent their societies
allow.
Collecting societies in several countries including Australia, Finland,
France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Taiwan, and the Netherlands take an
assignment of rights from creators in present and future works and manage them,
so that the societies effectively become the owner of these rights. (In France
it is called a “mandate” of rights but has similar practical effect.) Creators
in these jurisdictions who belong to collecting societies may not be able to
license their material under CC licenses because the collecting societies own
the necessary rights, not the creators. CC is working with several collecting societies and running
pilot programs that allow creators to use CC licenses in some
circumstances.
If you are already a member of a collecting society and want to use CC
licenses, you are welcome to encourage your collecting society to give you the
option of Creative Commons licensing.
Yes. One of our goals is to encourage creators and rights holders to
experiment with new ways to promote and market their work. There are several
possible ways of doing this.
CC’s NonCommercial (NC) licenses allow rights holders to
maximize distribution while maintaining control of the commercialization of
their works. If you want to reserve the right to commercialize your work, you
may do this by choosing a license with the NC condition. If someone else wants
to use your work commercially and you have applied an NC license to your work,
they must first get your permission. As the rights holder, you may still sell
your own work commercially.
You may also use funding models that do not depend on using an NC license.
For example, many artists and creators use crowdfunding to fund their work
before releasing it under a less restrictive license. Others use a “freemium”
model where the basic content is free, but extras such as a physical printed
version or special access to a members-only website are for paying customers
only.
For more information and ideas, The
Power of Open presents case studies of artists, businesspeople, and
organizations who use CC.

No. CC licenses allow for flexibility in the way credit is provided
depending on the medium, means, and context in which a licensee is
redistributing licensed material. For example, providing attribution to the
creator when using licensed material in a blog post may be different than doing
so in a video remix. This flexibility facilitates compliance by licensees and
reduces uncertainty about different types of reuse—minimizing the risk that
overly onerous and inflexible attribution requirements are simply
disregarded.

Yes—but if you change the terms and conditions of any Creative Commons
license, you must no longer call, label, or describe the license as a
“Creative Commons” or “CC” license, nor can you use the Creative Commons logos, buttons, or
other trademarks in connection with the modified license or your materials.
Keep in mind that altering terms and conditions is distinct from waiving
existing conditions or granting additional permissions than those in the
licenses. Licensors may always do so, and many choose to do so using the CC+
protocol to readily signal the waiver or additional permission on the CC
license deed.
CC does not assert copyright in the text of its licenses, so you are
permitted to modify the text as long as you do not use the CC marks to describe
it. However, we do not recommend this. We also advise against modifying our licenses through indirect means, such as in
your terms of service. A modified license very likely will not be compatible
with the same CC license (unmodified) applied to other material. This would
prevent licensees from using, combining, or remixing content under your
customized license with other content under the same or compatible CC
licenses.
Modifying licenses creates friction that confuses users and undermines the
key benefits of public, standardized licenses. Central to our licenses is the
grant of a standard set of permissions in advance, without requiring users to
ask for permission or seek clarification before using the work. This encourages
sharing and facilitates reuse, since everyone knows what to expect and the
burden of negotiating permissions on a case by case basis is eliminated.
Yes. You may always choose to waive some license terms or conditions.
Material licensed under a CC license but with additional permissions granted or
conditions waived may be compatibly licensed with other material under the same
license. Our CC+ protocol provides a mechanism for facilitating that
grant or waiver.

Yes. CC licenses are nonexclusive. Licensors always have the option of
entering into separate arrangements for the sharing of their material in
addition to applying a CC license. However, those different arrangements are
not “CC” or “Creative Commons” licenses.
Separate agreements: You may offer the licensed material
under other licenses in addition to the CC license (a practice commonly
referred to as “dual licensing”). For example, you may wish to license a video
game soundtrack under both a CC license and the GPL, so that it may be used
under either set of terms. A reuser may then choose which set of terms to
comply with. Or, for example, you may offer your material to the public under a
NonCommercial license, but offer commercial permissions to fee-paying
customers.
Supplemental agreements: Problems arise when licensors
design those terms or arrangements to serve not as separate, alternative
licensing arrangements but as supplemental terms having the
effect of changing the standard terms within the CC license. While you may
offer separate terms and conditions to other parties, you should not do so in
such a way that would neutralize terms of the CC license.
Except in the limited situation where more
permissions are being granted or license conditions are waived, if the
additional arrangement modifies or conflicts with the CC license terms, then
the resulting licensing arrangement is no longer a CC licensing arrangement. To
avoid confusing those who may mistakenly believe the work is licensed under
standard CC terms, we must insist that in these instances licensors not use our
trademarks, names, and logos
in connection with their custom licensing arrangement.
It should be noted that any agreements you make with other parties only have
an effect on the other parties to that agreement, and do not apply to anyone
else receiving the licensed material. For example, if there are terms of use
that apply to visitors to your website on which you host CC-licensed material,
your terms of use may apply to visitors to that website, but not to anyone who
receives copies of the CC-licensed material elsewhere. Even for the visitors to
your website, any separate terms and conditions do not become part of the
license—they remain a separate contractual agreement, and violation of this
agreement does not constitute copyright infringement.


Please see our guide on What to do if Your
CC-Licensed Work is Misused.
If someone has made an adaptation of your CC-licensed work in a way that you
no longer wish to be associated with, the adapter must comply with a request
that your name be removed. (See Section 3(a)(3) of CC 4.0 legal codes.)
If you believe that someone is using your work in a way that is violating
the license terms——for example, not giving correct credit, or using an NC work
commercially, we have a guide on license enforcement here: What to do if Your
CC-Licensed Work is Misused.
As a licensor, you may choose to receive under any name that you wish, such
as a pseudonym or pen name, or you may choose not to be credited by name at
all, and to publish anonymously. You do not have to be credited under your
legal name. Most jurisdictions permit this, but you should check to be sure
this is valid in your jurisdiction.
If someone has made an adaptation of your CC-licensed work in a way that you
no longer wish to be associated with, the adapter must comply with a request
that your name be removed. (See Section 3(a)(3) of CC 4.0 legal codes.)
The use of any
effective technical protection measures (such as digital rights management or
“DRM”) by licensees to prevent others from exercising the licensed rights
is prohibited.
Not all kinds of encryption or access limitations are prohibited by the licenses. For
example, sending content via email and encrypting it with the recipient’s
public key does not restrict use of the work by the recipient. Likewise,
limiting recipients to a particular set of users (for example, by requiring a
username and password to enter a site) does not restrict further use of the
content by the recipients. In these examples, these things do not prevent the
recipient from exercising all of the rights granted by the license, including
the right to redistribute it further.
If someone is applying effective technological measures to your CC-licensed
material that do restrict exercise of the licensed rights (such as applying DRM
that restricts copying), this is a violation of the license terms unless you
have chosen to grant this permission separately.
No. CC licenses grant permission to use the licensed material in any media
or format regardless of the format in which it has been made available. This is
true even if you have applied a NoDerivatives license to your work. Once a CC
license is applied to a work in one format or medium, a licensee may use the
same work in any other format or medium without violating the licensor’s
copyright.

CC licenses are not revocable. Once something has been published under a CC
license, licensees may continue using it according to the license terms for the
duration of applicable copyright and similar rights. As a licensor, you may
stop distributing under the CC license at any time, but anyone who has access
to a copy of the material may continue to redistribute it under the CC license
terms. While you cannot revoke the license, CC licenses do provide a mechanism for licensors to ask that others using their
material remove the attribution information. You should think
carefully before choosing a Creative Commons license.
 
CC offers six core
licenses, each of which grants a different set of permissions. Before you
use CC-licensed material, you should review the terms
of the particular license to be sure your anticipated use is permitted. If
you wish to use the work in a manner that is not permitted by the license, you
should contact the rights holder (often the creator) to get permission first,
or look for an alternative work that is licensed in a way that permits your
anticipated use. Note that if you use material in a way that is not permitted
by the applicable license and your use is not otherwise permitted by an
applicable copyright exception or limitation, the license is automatically terminated and you may be liable for
copyright infringement, even if you are eligible to have your rights reinstated
later.
Before using material offered under a Creative Commons license, you should
know that CC licenses only grant permissions needed under copyright and
similar rights, and there may be additional rights you need to use it as
intended. You should also understand that licensors do not offer warranties or
guarantees about the material they are licensing unless expressly indicated
otherwise. All materials are licensed “AS IS” and a disclaimer of warranties
applies unless expressly provided otherwise. If you want to ask for a warranty
or guarantee about rights to use the material, you should talk with the
licensor before using it.

It depends. CC licenses do not license rights other than copyright and similar rights (which include sui generis
database rights in version 4.0). For example, they do not license trademark
or patent rights, or the publicity, personality, and privacy rights of third
parties. However, licensors agree to waive or not assert any moral rights, publicity
rights, personality rights, or privacy rights they themselves hold, to the
limited extent necessary to allow exercise of the licensed rights. Any rights
outside of the scope of the license may require clearance (i.e., permission) in
order to use the work as you would like.
Additionally, creative works sometimes incorporate works owned by others
(known as “third party content”), often used pursuant to a CC license or under
an exception or limitation to copyright such as fair use in the U.S. You should
make sure you have permission to use any third party content contained in the
work you want to use, or that your use is otherwise allowed under the laws of
your jurisdiction, particularly in cases such as fair use where your right to
use the content depends on the particular context in which you plan to use
it.
All CC licenses contain a disclaimer of warranties, meaning that the
licensor is not guaranteeing anything about the work, including whether she
owns the copyright, has received permission to include third-party content
within her work, or secured other rights such as through the use of model
releases if a person’s image is used in the work. You may wish to obtain legal advice before using CC-licensed
material if you are not sure whether you have all the rights you need.
In the somewhat limited circumstances where sui generis database rights
apply to your use, special conditions apply and there are more specific
considerations you should be aware of. Under 4.0, sui generis database rights
are licensed alongside copyright, but the treatment in earlier versions of the
license varies. A fuller explanation of these variations and related
considerations is available in the Data
FAQ.
If you are looking for material offered under a Creative Commons license, CC Search is a good starting
point. There is also a directory of organizations and individuals who use CC
licenses. Some media sites, such as Flickr, have search filters for material
licensed using CC’s licenses.
Be sure to confirm that the material you want to use is actually under a CC
license, as search results may sometimes be misleading.

Yes. While many if not most CC-licensed works are available at no cost, some
licensors charge for initial access to CC-licensed works—for example, by
publishing CC-licensed content only to subscribers, or by charging for
downloads. However, even if you have paid an access charge, once you have a
copy of CC-licensed material, you may make any further uses permitted by the
license without paying licensing fees.
(If you wish to make uses that are not permitted by the license—for example,
making a commercial use of an NC-licensed photo—the licensor may
charge for those additional rights.)
As a licensee, you should always read and understand the relevant license’s
legal code before using CC-licensed material, particularly if you are using
material that is licensed using a ported license with which you are unfamiliar. Our porting
process involved adapting the international licenses to the legal framework of
different jurisdictions, and in that process slight adjustments may have been
made that you should make yourself aware of in advance of using the material.
You can find more information about the ported licenses in the Jurisdiction Database.
There are currently no ported versions of 4.0, and we expect there will be
few, if any, in the future. All official translations of the 4.0 international
licenses are equivalent: you may substitute one for another depending on your
preferred language.
However, the ported versions of 3.0 and earlier sometimes contain small
differences from the international license depending on the ways in which they
have been adapted to their jurisdictions. For example, a handful of the ported
licenses contain provisions specifying which laws will apply in the event the
licensor chooses to enforce the license, and a few of the ported licenses
contain forum selection clauses.
 
Contact the rights holders to ask for permission. Otherwise, unless an exception or limitation to copyright applies,
your use of the material may violate the Creative Commons license. If you
violate the terms of the license, your rights to use the material will be automatically terminated, and you may be liable for
copyright infringement.
You need to comply with the license terms if what you are doing would
otherwise require permission from the rights holder. If your use would not
require permission from the rights holder because it falls under an exception
or limitation, such as fair use, or because the material has come into the
public domain, the license does not apply, and you do not need to comply with
its terms and conditions. Additionally, if you are using an excerpt small
enough to be uncopyrightable, the license does not apply to your use, and you
do not need to comply with its terms.
However, if you are using excerpts of CC-licensed material which
individually are minimal and do not require license compliance, but together
make up a significant copyrightable chunk, you must comply with the license
terms. For example, if you quote many individual lines from a poem across
several sections of a blog post, and your use is not a fair use, you must
comply with the license even though no individual line would have been a
substantial enough portion of the work to require this.
 
All CC licenses require users to attribute the creator of licensed material,
unless the creator has waived that requirement, not supplied a name, or asked that her name be removed. Additionally, you must
retain a copyright notice, a link to the license (or to the deed), a license
notice, a notice about the disclaimer of warranties, and a URI if reasonable.
For versions prior to 4.0, you must also provide the title of the work. (Though
it is not a requirement in 4.0, it is still recommended if one is
supplied.)
You must also indicate if you have modified the work—for example, if you have taken an
excerpt, or cropped a photo. (For versions prior to 4.0, this is only required
if you have created an adaptation by contributing your own creative material,
but it is recommended even when not required.) It is not necessary to note
trivial alterations, such as correcting a typo or changing a font size.
Finally, you must retain an indication of previous modifications to the
work.
CC licenses have a flexible attribution requirement, so there is not
necessarily one correct way to provide attribution. The proper method for
giving credit will depend on the medium and means you are using, and may be
implemented in any reasonable manner. Additionally, you may satisfy the
attribution requirement by providing a link to a place where the attribution
information may be found.
While the attribution requirements in the license are the minimum
requirement, we always recommend that you follow the best practices for the kind of use you are
making. For example, if you are using scientific data marked with CC0, you are
not required to give attribution at all, but we recommend that you give the
same credit you would give to any other source—not because the license requires
it, but because that is the standard for letting others know the source of the
data.
The CC website offers some best practices to help you attribute properly, and the CC Australia team has developed a
helpful
guide to attributing CC-licensed material (.pdf) in different formats. Note
that the attribution and marking requirements vary slightly among license
versions. See here for a chart comparing the specific requirements.

Yes. You need to be careful not to imply any sponsorship, endorsement, or
connection with the licensor or attribution party without their permission.
Wrongfully implying that a creator, publisher, or anyone else endorses you or
your use of a work may be unlawful. Creative Commons makes the obligation not
to imply endorsement explicit in its licenses. In addition, if the licensor of
a work requests that you remove the identifying credit, you must
do so to the extent practical.
Additionally, when you are using a work that is an adaptation of one or more
pre-existing works, you may need to give credit to the creator(s) of the pre-existing work(s),
in addition to giving credit to the creator of the adaptation.
You must attribute the creator when you provide material to the public by
any means that is restricted by copyright or similar rights. If you are using
the material personally but are not making it or any adaptations of it
available to others, you do not have to attribute the licensor. Similarly, if
you are only distributing the material or adaptations of it within your company
or organization, you do not have to comply with the attribution requirement.
Learn more about when compliance with the license is not
required.


CC’s NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit uses that are “primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.” This is
intended to capture the intention of the NC-using community without placing
detailed restrictions that are either too broad or too narrow. Please note that
CC’s definition does not turn on the type of user: if you are a nonprofit or
charitable organization, your use of an NC-licensed work could still run afoul
of the NC restriction, and if you are a for-profit entity, your use of an
NC-licensed work does not necessarily mean you have violated the term. Whether
a use is commercial will depend on the specifics of the situation and the
intentions of the user.
In CC’s experience, it is usually relatively easy to determine whether a use
is permitted, and known conflicts are relatively few considering the popularity
of the NC licenses. However, there will always be uses that are challenging to
categorize as commercial or noncommercial. CC cannot advise you on what is and
is not commercial use. If you are unsure, you should either contact the rights
holder for clarification, or search for works that permit commercial uses.
CC has a brief guide to interpretation of the NC license that goes
into more detail about the meaning of the NC license and some key points to pay
attention to. Additionally, in 2008, Creative Commons published results from a survey on
meanings of commercial and noncommercial use generally. Note that the results
of the study are not intended to serve as CC’s official interpretation of what
is and is not commercial use under our licenses, and the results should not be
relied upon as such.
Yes. When any of the six CC licenses is applied to material, licensees are
granted permission to use the material as the license allows, whatever the
media or format chosen by the user when it is used or distributed further. This
is true even in our NoDerivatives licenses. This is one of a very few default
rules established in our licenses, to harmonize what may be different outcomes
depending on where CC-licensed material is reused and what jurisdiction’s
copyright law applies.
This means, for example, that even if a creator distributes a work in
digital format, you have permission to print and share a hard copy of the same
work.

As with most copyright questions, it will depend on applicable law.
Generally, to be different works under copyright law, there must be expressive
or original choices made that make one work a separate and distinct work from
another. The determination depends on the standards for copyright in the
relevant jurisdiction.
Under U.S. copyright law, for example, mechanical reproduction of a work
into a different format is
unlikely to create a separate, new work. Consequently, digitally enhancing
or changing the format of a work absent some originality, such as
expressive choices made in the enhancement or encoding, will not likely create
a separate work for copyright purposes. The creative bar is low, but it is not
non-existent. Accordingly, in some jurisdictions releasing a photograph under a
CC license will give the public permission to reuse the photograph in a
different resolution.
The NoDerivs licenses (BY-ND and BY-NC-ND) prohibit reusers from creating
adaptations. What constitutes an adaptation, otherwise known
as a derivative work, varies slightly based on the law of the relevant
jurisdiction.
Incorporating an unaltered excerpt from an ND-licensed work into a larger
work only creates an adaptation if the larger work can be said to be built upon
and derived from the work from which the excerpt was taken. Generally, no
derivative work is made of the original from which the excerpt was taken when
the excerpt is used to illuminate an idea or provide an example in another
larger work. Instead, only the reproduction right of the original copyright
holder is being exercised by person reusing the excerpt. All CC licenses grant
the right to reproduce a CC-licensed work for noncommercial purposes (at a
minimum). For example, a person could make copies of one chapter of an
ND-licensed book and not be in violation of the license so long as other
conditions of the license are met.
There are exceptions to that general rule, however, when the excerpts are
combined with other material in a way that creates some new version of the
original from which the excerpt is taken. For example, if a portion of a song
was used as part of a new song, that may rise to the level of creating an
adaptation of the original song, even though only a portion of it was used and
even if that portion was used as-is.
No. When you receive material under a Creative Commons license, you may not
place additional terms and conditions on the reuse of the work. This includes
using effective technological measures (ETMs) that would restrict a licensee’s
ability to exercise the licensed rights.
A technological measure is considered an ETM if circumventing it carries
penalties under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, or similar international
agreements. Generally, this means that the anti-circumvention laws of various
jurisdictions would cover attempts to break it.
For example, if you remix a CC-licensed song, and you wish to share it on a
music site that places digital copy-restriction on all uploaded files, you may
not do this without express permission from the licensor. However, if you
upload that same file to your own site or any other site that does not apply
DRM to the file, and a listener chooses to stream it through an app that
applies DRM, you have not violated the license.
Note that merely converting material into a different format that is
difficult to access or is only available for certain platforms does not violate
the restriction; you may do this without violating the license terms.
Yes. This is not considered to be a prohibited measure, so long as the
protection is merely limiting who may access the content, and does not restrict
the authorized recipients from exercising the licensed rights. For example, you
may post material under any CC license on a site restricted to members of a
certain school, or to paying customers, but you may not place effective technological measures (including
DRM) on the files that prevents them from sharing the material
elsewhere.
(Note that charging for access may not be permitted with NC-licensed
material; however, it is not disallowed by the restriction on ETMs.)
Yes. All CC licenses allow redistribution of the unmodified material by any
means, including distribution via file-sharing networks. Note that file-trading
is expressly considered to be noncommercial for purposes of compliance with the
NC licenses. Barter of NC-licensed material for other items of value is not
permitted.
It is always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the terms and
conditions that apply to any service you are using. Generally speaking, most
social media platforms allow users to keep the copyright they have in their
content and ask users to grant them a copyright license to use that content for
purposes of providing their service. In some cases, platforms may also ask for
a license to use your content in advertising and other promotions of their
service. Creative Commons licenses do not allow sublicensing, which means you
cannot grant a license to a platform with respect to the rights in any
CC-licensed content you do not own. For example, if you share on Facebook a
CC-licensed image you downloaded from Flickr, you cannot grant Facebook any
rights to that image under copyright. However, it is unusual for social media
platforms to require you to own or control the copyright on all content you
share on their sites. Instead, they often simply require that you have the
rights to post it. As with content in the public domain or copyrighted content
you are using under fair use or some other exception or limitation to
copyright, when you share third party CC-licensed content on a platform, you
aren’t granting that platform any rights to the content under copyright. When
sharing CC-licensed content, always remember to provide proper attribution and
otherwise comply with the relevant license conditions.
Don’t forget that a CC license only speaks to copyright, and there may be
other rights (for example, privacy rights) that are relevant when sharing on
social media.
If you have received material under a CC license that is encumbered with
effective technological measures (such as digital rights management or DRM),
you may or may not be permitted to break it, depending on the circumstances. By
releasing material under a CC license, the licensor agrees not to assert any
rights she may have to prevent the circumvention of effective technological
measures. (Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, this is implied but not
explicit.) However, if she has uploaded it to a site or other distribution
channel that itself applies such measures, that site may have the right to
prevent you from breaking them, even though the licensor herself cannot do
so.
Note that anti-circumvention laws can impose criminal liability in some
jurisdictions.
It is possible that CC-licensed material will appear on platforms that
impose terms in addition to the copyright license (though Creative Commons strongly discourages restrictions that
interfere with exercise of the licensed rights). These additional terms do
not form part of the license for the work and may not be applicable to
distributions of the work outside of the platform. For example, if you download
CC-licensed material from a site that does not permit downloading, you may be
breaking the terms of use of the site, but you are not infringing the CC
license. See our guide to Modifying the CC licenses for more guidance and
information.

Whether a modification of licensed material is considered an adaptation for the purpose
of CC licenses depends primarily on the applicable copyright law. Copyright law
reserves to an original creator the right to create adaptations of the original
work. CC licenses that allow for adaptations to be shared—all except BY-ND and
BY-NC-ND—grant permission to others to create and redistribute adaptations when
doing so would otherwise constitute a violation of applicable copyright law.
Generally, a modification rises to the level of an adaptation under copyright
law when the modified work is based on the prior work but manifests sufficient
new creativity to be copyrightable, such as a translation of a novel from one
language to another, or the creation of a screenplay based on a novel.
Under CC licenses, synching music in timed relation with a moving image is
always considered an adaptation, whether or not it would be considered so under
applicable law. Also, under version 4.0, certain uses of databases restricted
by sui generis database rights also constitute adaptations (called “Adapted
Material” in the 4.0 licenses), whether or not they would be considered
adaptations under copyright law. For more details about adaptations in the
database context, see the Data FAQ.
Note that all CC licenses allow the user to exercise the rights permitted
under the license in any format or medium. Those changes are not considered
adaptations even if applicable law would suggest otherwise. For example, you
may redistribute a book that uses the CC BY-NC-ND license
in print form when it was originally distributed online, even if you have had
to make formatting changes to do so, as long as you do so in compliance with
the other terms of the license.
Note on terminology: throughout these FAQs, we use the term
“remix” interchangeably with “adapt.” Both are designed to mean doing something
that constitutes an adaptation under copyright law.



It depends. The first question to ask is whether doing so constitutes an adaptation. If the combination does
not create an adaptation, then you may combine any
CC-licensed content so long as you provide attribution and comply with the
NonCommercial restriction if it applies. If you want to combine material in a
way that results in the creation of an adaptation (i.e. a “remix”), then you
must pay attention to the particular license that applies to the content you
want to combine.
The NoDerivatives licenses do not permit remixing except for private use
(the pre-4.0 licenses do not permit remixing at all, except as allowed by
exceptions and limitations to copyright). All the other CC licenses allow
remixes, but may impose limitations or conditions on how the remix may be used.
For example, if you create a remix with material licensed under a ShareAlike
license, you need to make sure that all of the material contributed to the
remix is licensed under the same license or one that CC has named as
compatible, and you must properly credit all of the sources with the required attribution and license information. Similarly,
if you want to use a remix for commercial purposes, you cannot incorporate material
released under one of the NonCommercial licenses.
The chart below shows which CC-licensed material can be remixed. To use the
chart, find a license on the left column and on the top right row. If there is
a check mark in the box where that row and column intersect, then the works can
be remixed. If there is an “X” in the box, then the works may not be remixed
unless an exception or limitation applies. See below for details on how remixes may be licensed.



If you make adaptations of material under a CC license (i.e. “remix”),
the original CC license always applies to the material you are adapting even
once adapted. The license you may choose for your own contribution (called your
“adapter’s license”) depends on which license applies to the original material.
Recipients of the adaptation must comply with both the CC license on the
original and your adapter’s license.
When remixing BY or BY-NC material, it is generally recommended that your
adapter’s license include at least the same license elements as the license
applied to the original material. This eases reuse for downstream users because
they are able to satisfy both licenses by complying with the adapter’s license.
For example, if you adapt material licensed under BY-NC, your adapter’s license
should also contain the NC restriction. See the chart below for more
details.
In general, when remixing ShareAlike content, your adapter’s license must be
the same license as the license on the material you are adapting. All licenses
after version 1.0 also allow you to license your contributions under a later
version of the same license, and some also allow ported licenses. (See the license versions page for details.) If you wish to adapt
material under BY-SA or BY-NC-SA and release your contributions under a non-CC
license, you should visit the Compatibility page to
see which options are allowed.
The BY-ND and BY-NC-ND licenses do not permit distribution of adaptations
(also known as remixes or derivative works), and prohibits the creation of
adaptations under the pre-4.0 versions of those licenses. Since you may not
share remixes of these materials at all, there is no compatibility with other
licenses. (Note that the ND licenses do allow you to reproduce the material in
unmodified form together with other material in a collection, as indicated in
the next FAQ.)
The chart below details the CC license(s) you may use as your adapter’s
license. When creating an adaptation of material under the license identified
in the lefthand column, you may license your contributions to the adaptation
under one of the licenses indicated on the top row if the corresponding box is
green. CC does not recommend using a license if the corresponding box is
yellow, although doing so is technically permitted by the terms of the license.
If you do, you should take additional care to mark the adaptation as involving
multiple copyrights under different terms so that downstream users are aware of
their obligations to comply with the licenses from all rights holders. Dark
gray boxes indicate those licenses that you may not use as your adapter’s
license.

All Creative Commons licenses (including the version 4.0 licenses) allow
licensed material to be included in collections such as anthologies,
encyclopedias, and broadcasts. You may choose a license for the collection,
however this does not change the license applicable to the original
material.
When you include CC-licensed content in a collection, you still must adhere
to the license conditions governing your use of the material incorporated. For
example, material under any of the Creative Commons NonCommercial licenses
cannot be used commercially. The table below indicates what type of
CC-licensed works you may incorporate into collections licensed for commercial
and noncommercial uses.
Creative Commons licenses expire when the underlying copyright and similar
rights expire.
Note that the relevant rights may expire at different times. For example,
you may have a CC-licensed song where the rights in the musical arrangement
expire before the rights in the lyrics. In this case, when the copyright in the
music expires, you may use it without being required to comply with the conditions of the CC
license; however, you must still comply with the license if you use the
lyrics.
The CC licenses are irrevocable. This means that once you receive material
under a CC license, you will always have the right to use it under those
license terms, even if the licensor changes his or her mind and stops
distributing under the CC license terms. Of course, you may choose to respect
the licensor’s wishes and stop using the work.
All of the CC licenses terminate if you fail to follow the license
conditions. If this happens, you no longer have a license to use the
material.
In the 4.0 licenses, your rights under the license are automatically
reinstated if you correct this failure within 30 days of discovering the
violation (either on your own or because the licensor or someone else has told
you). Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, there is no automatic
reinstatement.
If you have lost your rights under a CC license and are not entitled to
automatic reinstatement, you may regain your rights under the license if the
licensor expressly grants you permission. You cannot simply re-download the
material to get a new license.
Note that you may still be liable for damages for copyright infringement for
the period where you were not in compliance with the license.

The Creative Commons licenses have three layers, as does the CC0 public domain dedication:
the human-readable deed, the lawyer-readable legal code, and the
machine-readable metadata. The Public Domain
Mark is not legally operative, and so has only two layers: the
human-readable mark and machine-readable metadata.
When material is licensed using any of the CC licenses or tools, it is
highly recommended that a CC button, text, or
other marker somehow accompany it. There are many possible modes for marking.
For our licenses, people generally use the CC license chooser to generate
HTML code that can be pasted into the webpage where the licensed material is
published. CC0 and the Public Domain Mark have a separate chooser. Many platforms
and web services such as Flickr and Drupal support CC licensing directly,
allowing you to select an appropriate license. The service then properly marks
the work for you.
CC has published some best practices for marking your CC-licensed material, and recommends:
See the marking page for more details.
Creative Commons has specified CC REL as a way to associate machine-readable
licensing metadata with objects offered under CC licenses.
Before Creative Commons developed this vocabulary, it was difficult for a
machine to ascertain whether an object was marked with a CC license. There was
also no standard, predictable place to house metadata about that license (for
example, the source URL of the work or the required mode of attribution).
Machine-readable metadata based on well-accepted metadata standards creates
a platform upon which new services and applications can be built. Software and
services can detect CC licenses and the details of that license, as described
by the metadata. For example, on many websites and search engines such as
Google and Flickr, you can run filtered searches for works offered under
specific CC licenses. In addition, CC license deeds can automatically create
copy-and-paste attribution code so users may easily comply with the BY
condition of the licenses. When you click on a CC license or button from a page with
license metadata, you get copy-and-paste attribution HTML within that license
deed page. That HTML is based on available RDFa metadata in the original
material.
All HTML provided by the CC
license chooser is automatically annotated with metadata in RDFa
format.

RDFa is a method for embedding structured data in a web
page. For more information about RDFa, see the following resources:

Creative Commons Rights
Expression Language (CC REL) renders information about licenses and works
machine-readable through standards that define the semantic web. Creative
Commons wants to make it easy for creators and scientists to build upon the
works of others when they choose; licensing your work for reuse and ﬁnding
properly licensed works to reuse should be easy. CC recommends that you mark
your licensed works with CC REL. The Creative Commons license chooser provides
HTML annotated with CC REL, while the Creative Commons deeds recognize CC REL
on web pages with works offered under a CC license, and use this metadata to
enhance the deed for properly marked-up works, e.g., by providing copy and
paste HTML that includes work attribution.
For more background information on CC REL, please refer to this paper.
Some search engines (like Google) allow people to
filter their search results by usage rights so that you can limit your search
results according to the particular CC license you seek. For example, if you
are looking for a photo to adapt, you can filter your search to return photos
that have a CC license that permits creation of adaptations. You can generally
find this search feature on the advanced search page of your selected search
engine. You can also use CC
Search, which offers a convenient interface to search and a list of those
content providers that support searches for content based on usage rights.
Please note, however, that you should always double check to make sure that
the work you locate through a search is licensed as you wish.


Creative Commons provides tools for integrating license selection with your
site. You can find an overview at the Web Integration article on the CC wiki. The Partner Interface
is a good way to get started and will always have the most up-to-date license
versions and translations. However, there is also an API available if you want more
control.
Mozilla has included the Creative Commons search function in many versions
of Firefox along with search options for Google, Amazon, and other popular
sites. Please take a look at the Firefox article on
the CC wiki for an explanation of how to change these features.
If you want to add or remove a particular search option, click on the logo
in the search box (for example, the CC logo or the Google logo). This will open
the pull down menu, which will allow you to select different search providers.
If you choose “Manage Search Engines,” you will be able to add or remove search
engines. You can also alter the order in which the search providers appear on
the pull down menu.
No. CC licenses are a form of rights expression, not rights management. CC
provides tools to make it easier for creators and owners to say which rights
they reserve and permissions they grant. This is different from digital rights
management (or “DRM”), which uses technological protection measures to prevent
people from using the work in a way that the owner has not permitted.
CC licenses contain language prohibiting licensees from the use of effective
technological measures (including DRM) to prevent access to licensed material:
”You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions
on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any such recipient.”
While licensors may apply effective technological measures (ETMs) to their
own materials, the licensor provides a limited
permission to circumvent these measures: “The Licensor waives and/or agrees
not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.” Note
that this only applies to effective technological measures applied by licensors
themselves: third parties such as distribution platforms may still apply ETMs
if the licensor uploads there, and the license is not able to grant you
permission to circumvent it.
Copyright law grants exclusive rights to creators of original works of
authorship. National laws usually extend protections to such works
automatically once fixed in a tangible medium, prohibiting the making of copies
without the rights holder’s permission, among other things. On the internet,
even the most basic activities involve making copies of copyrighted content. As
content is increasingly uploaded, downloaded, and shared online, copyright law
is becoming more relevant to more people than it was 20 years ago.
Unfortunately, infringing copyrights—even unintentionally or unknowingly—can
lead to liability. Successful navigation of the internet requires some
understanding of copyright law.
The public domain of copyright refers to the aggregate of those works that
are not restricted by copyright within a given jurisdiction. A work may be part
of the public domain because the applicable term of copyright has expired,
because the rights holder surrendered copyright in the work with a tool like CC0, or because the work did
not meet the applicable standards for copyrightability.
Because the public domain depends on the copyright laws in force within a
particular territory, sometimes a work may be considered “in the public domain”
of one jurisdiction, but not in another. For example, U.S. government works
are automatically in the public domain under U.S. copyright law, but might
be restricted by copyright in other countries.
The Public Domain Manifesto,
the University
Libraries page, and the CC0 FAQs all contain
additional information about the public domain.
 
 
Copyright in most jurisdictions attaches automatically without need for any
formality once a creative work is fixed in tangible form (i.e. the minute you
put pen to paper, take a photo, or hit the “save” button on your computer).
In some jurisdictions, creators may be required to register with a national
agency in order to enforce copyright in court. If you would like more
information, please consult the Berne
Convention or your
jurisdiction’s copyright law.
Although you do not have to apply a copyright notice for your work to be
protected, it may be a useful tool to clearly signal to people that the work is
yours. It also tells the public who to contact about the work.

An adaptation is a work based on one or more pre-existing works. What
constitutes an adaptation depends on applicable law, however translating a work
from one language to another or creating a film version of a novel are
generally considered adaptations.
In order for an adaptation to be protected by copyright, most national laws
require the creator of the adaptation to add original expression to the
pre-existing work. However, there is no international standard for originality,
and the definition differs depending on the jurisdiction. Civil law
jurisdictions (such as Germany and France)
tend to require that the work contain an imprint of the adapter’s personality.
Common law jurisdictions (such as the U.S. or Canada), on the other
hand, tend to have a lower threshold for originality, requiring only a minimal
level of creativity and “independent conception.” Some countries approach
originality completely differently. For example, Brazil’s
copyright code protects all works of the mind that do not fall within the list
of works that are expressly defined in the statue as “unprotected works.”
Consult your
jurisdiction’s copyright law for more information.

Copyright laws in many jurisdictions around the world grant creators “moral
rights” in addition to the economic or commercial right to exploit their
creative works. Moral rights protect the personal and reputational value of a
work for its creator. Moral rights differ by country, and can include the right
of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or
pseudonymously, and/or the right to the integrity of the work. The moral right
of integrity may provide creators with a source for redress if an adaptation
represents derogatory treatment of their work, typically defined as “distortion
or mutilation” of the work or treatment that is “prejudicial to the honor, or
reputation of the author.” Not all jurisdictions provide for moral rights.
The CC licenses are intended to minimize the effect of moral rights on a
licensee’s ability to use licensed material; however, in some jurisdictions,
these rights may still have an effect. CC offers some additional information on
how CC licenses may affect your moral rights.
Copyright provides an incentive to create works by providing exclusive
rights to creators. However, the distribution or exploitation of a work often
involves more than just the creator. For example, if someone writes a song,
someone else may perform the song, and another may produce the recording of the
song. Some jurisdictions extend copyright to the contributions made by these
persons; other jurisdictions extend such exclusive rights in the form of
neighboring rights. Neighboring rights may include performers’ rights or
broadcasters’ rights, among others. The Rome
Convention sets forth some guidelines on the scope of neighboring rights.
Not all jurisdictions recognize neighboring rights.
Sui generis database rights grant qualifying database makers the right to
prohibit the extraction and reuse of a substantial portion of a database. The
rights are granted to database makers that make a substantial investment of
time and resources to create the database. Sui generis database rights are
primarily enacted within the European Union and a handful of other
jurisdictions.
Collecting
societies are copyright management organizations. Some examples of
collecting societies include ASCAP and BMI (United States), BUMA/STEMRA
(Netherlands), PRS (United Kingdom), and APRA (Australia). These societies
license works on behalf of their owners and process royalty payments from
parties using the copyrighted works.
CC offers additional information on how collecting societies might affect your rights and your
ability to apply CC licenses to your work. CC has several pilots
underway with collecting societies that have chosen to allow their members to
use CC licenses on a limited basis.
 
These terms are used differently in different jurisdictions. Generally
speaking, these rights allow individuals to control the use of their voice,
image, likeness, or other identifiable aspect of their identity, especially for
purposes of commercial exploitation. Similarly, in some jurisdictions these
rights allow people to restrict others’ ability to publish information about
them without their permission. Whether and to what extent these rights exist,
and if so, how they are labeled, varies depending on the jurisdiction.
Creative Commons licenses have a limited effect on these
rights where the licensor holds them. Where the licensor has publicity,
personality, or privacy rights that may affect your ability to use the material
as the license intends, the licensor agrees to waive or not assert those
rights. However, any such rights not held by the licensor are not affected and
may still affect your desired use of a licensed work. If you have created a
work or wish to use a work that might in some way implicate these rights, you
may need to obtain permission from the individuals whose rights may be
affected.
This page supersedes Databases and Creative Commons.
Much of the potential value of data is to society at large — more data has
the potential to facilitate enhanced scientific collaboration and
reproducibility, more efficient markets, increased government and corporate
transparency, and overall to speed discovery and understanding of solutions to
planetary and societal needs.
A big part of the potential value of data, in particular its society-wide
value, is realized by use across organizational boundaries. How does this occur
legally? Many sites give narrow permission to use data via terms of service.
Much ad hoc data sharing also occurs among researchers. And increasingly,
sharing of data is facilitated by distribution under standard, public legal
tools used to manage copyright and similar restrictions that might otherwise
limit dissemination or reuse of data, e.g. CC licenses or the CC0 public domain
dedication.
Many organizations, institutions, and governments are using CC tools for
data. For case studies about how these tools are applied, see:
: Uses of CC Licenses with Data and Databases : Uses of CC0 with Data and Databases
Yes, CC licenses can be used to license databases. The most
recent version (4.0) may be used to license databases subject to copyright and,
where applicable, sui generis database rights. Sui generis database rights
prevent copying and reusing of substantial parts of a database (including frequent
extraction of insubstantial parts). However unlike copyright, database rights
protect the maker’s investment, not originality.
CC does not recommend use of its NonCommercial (NC) or NoDerivatives (ND)
licenses on databases intended for scholarly or scientific use.
In addition to our licenses, the CC0
Public Domain Dedication may be used on databases to maximize reuse of
databases. When applied, the effect is to waive all copyright and related
rights in the database and its contents, placing it as close as possible into
the worldwide public domain. In certain domains, such as science and
government, there are important reasons to consider using CC0. Waiving
copyright and related rights eliminates all uncertainty for potential users,
encouraging maximal reuse and sharing of information.
The license terms and conditions apply to the database structure (its
selection and arrangement, to the extent copyrightable), its contents (if
copyrightable), and in those instances where the database maker has sui generis database rights then the rights that are
granted those makers. Notwithstanding, licensors can choose to license some
rather than all of the rights they have in a database. Creative Commons advises
against this practice. However, if a licensor chooses to do so anyway, we
strongly encourage licensors to clearly demarcate what is and is not licensed.
See below for more information regarding how to provide clear
notice of what is licensed.
Before making a database available under a CC license, a database provider
should first make sure she has all rights necessary to do so. Often, the
database provider is not the original author of the database contents. If that
is the case, the database provider should secure separate permission from the
other author(s) before publishing the database under a CC legal tool. If a
database maker decides to license the database without securing permission from
the author(s) of the database contents, it should clearly indicate the material
for which permission has not been secured and clearly mark the material as not
being offered under the terms of the license. For more information, read our pre-licensing
guidelines.
Database providers should also consider carefully what elements of the

“wikilink”) for more information on how to clearly distinguish unlicensed
content.
Under version 4.0, if an NC license has been applied then any use of the
licensed database or its contents that is restricted by copyright law or sui generis database rights requires compliance with the
NC term, even if the database is not publicly shared. The
other license elements (BY, ND, and SA, as applicable) must be complied with
only if your use is so restricted and public sharing is involved. Learn more
about how to comply when your use implicates copyright and/or sui generis database rights.
Prior CC license versions do not require compliance with the license
restrictions or conditions when only sui generis database rights (and not
copyright) are implicated. Please see below for more detail about how this works in the current and prior versions of the licenses.
Yes. However, you should be aware that whether you have to comply with the
CC license terms and conditions will depend on whether the type of mining
activity you conduct implicates copyright or any applicable sui generis
database rights. If you are not exercising an exclusive right held by the
database maker, then you do not need to rely on the license to mine. Because
there are many different methods for conducting text and data mining, however,
there may be some types of mining activities that will implicate the licensed
rights.
If and only if your particular use is one that would require
permission, you should note the following:
If
your use is not one that requires permission under the license, you may
conduct text and data mining activity without regard to the above
considerations.
As explained above, the current version of the CC license suite (4.0)
licenses sui generis database rights in addition to copyright and other closely
related rights. Past versions of CC licenses operate differently with respect
to sui generis database rights.
In the CC version 3.0 licenses, the legal treatment of sui generis database
rights varies, but the practical result is always the same: compliance with the
license restrictions and conditions is not required where sui generis database
rights–but not copyright–are implicated. This means that if someone extracts a
substantial portion of a CC-licensed database and uses it in a way that does
not implicate copyright (e.g., by rearranging purely factual data), the license
does not require her to attribute the licensor or comply with any other
restrictions or conditions, even if the database is protected by sui generis
database rights.
While this result is the same across all CC version 3.0 licenses, the reason
for this outcome varies. In the 3.0 licenses ported to the laws of EU
jurisdictions, the scope of the licenses expressly cover databases subject to
copyright and/or sui generis database rights. However, the conditions of the
license are explicitly waived when use of the licensed work only involves the
exercise of database rights.
By contrast, the 3.0 unported licenses and all other ported licenses do not
expressly license sui generis database rights. As a result, those licenses do
not apply when sui generis database rights alone are implicated. This means a
licensee may need separate permission to use the database in a way that
implicates sui generis database rights (although arguably an implied license to
exercise those rights may be deemed granted in some jurisdictions).
More information on the underlying 3.0 policy decision the treatment of sui
generis database rights those licenses can be found on
our wiki (.pdf).
The Open Database
License (ODbL) and the Open Data Commons
Attribution License (ODC-BY) are licenses designed specifically for use on
databases and not on other types of material. There are many differences
between those licenses and CC licenses, but the most important to be aware of
relate to license scope and operation. The ODC licenses apply only to sui
generis database rights and any copyright in the database structure, they do
not apply to the individual contents of the database. The latest version of the
CC licenses on the other hand apply to sui generis database rights and all
copyright and neighboring rights in the database structure as well as the
contents. (See above for more detail about how past versions of CC
licenses vary with respect to sui generis database rights.)
Another important difference is that ODC licenses may create contractual
obligations even in jurisdictions where database rights would not otherwise
exist and but for the license permission would not be necessary. CC has crafted
its licenses to ensure that they never
impose obligations where permission is not otherwise required to use the
licensed material.
With databases, there are likely four components to consider: (1) the
database model or structure, (2) the data entry and output sheet, (3) field
names, and (4) the data or other content.
The database model refers to how a database is structured
and organized, including database tables and table indexes. The selection,
coordination, and arrangement of the database is subject to copyright if it is
sufficiently original. The originality threshold is fairly low in many
jurisdictions. For example, while courts in the United States have held that an
alphabetical telephone directory was insufficiently original to merit copyright
protection, an organized directory of Chinese-American businesses in a
particular area did.1 These determinations are very fact-specific
(no pun intended) and vary by jurisdiction.
The data entry and output sheets contain questions, and the
answers to these questions are stored in a database. For example, a web page
asking a scientist to enter a gene’s name, its pathway information, and its
ontology would constitute a data entry sheet. The format and layout of these
sheets are protected by copyright according to the same standard of originality
used to determine if the database model is copyrightable.
Field names describe the contents or data. For example,
“address” might be the name of the field for street address information. These
are less likely to be protected by copyright because they often lack sufficient
originality.
The data or other contents contained in the database are
subject to copyright if they are sufficiently creative. Original poems
contained in a database would be protected by copyright, but purely factual
data (such as gene names or city populations) would not. Facts are not subject
to copyright, nor are the ideas underlying copyrighted content.
When the database structure or its contents is subject to copyright,
reproducing, distributing, or modifying the database will often be restricted
by copyright law. However, it is important to note that some uses of a
copyrighted database will not be restricted by copyright. It may be possible,
for example, to rearrange or modify the uncopyrightable data in a way that does
not implicate the copyright in the database structure. For example, while (as
noted above) a court in the United States held that a directory of
Chinese-American businesses was restricted by copyright, the same court went on
to hold that a directory that duplicated hundreds of its listings was not
infringing because the listings were categorized and arranged in a sufficiently
dissimilar way. In those situations, compliance with the license conditions is
not required unless the database contents are themselves restricted by
copyright.
Similarly, even where database contents are subject to copyright and
published under a CC license, use of the facts and ideas embedded within the
contents will not require attribution (or compliance with other applicable
license conditions), unless doing so implicates copyright in the database
structure as explained above. This important limitation of all CC licenses
is highlighted on the license deeds in the Notice section, where we emphasize
that compliance with the license is not required for elements of the material
in the public domain.
All CC licenses require that you attribute the licensor when your use
involves public sharing. Your other obligations depend on the particular CC
license applied to the database. If it is a NC license, any regulated use must
be limited to noncommercial purposes only. If a ND is applied, you may
produce an adapted database but cannot share it publicly. If it is a ShareAlike
(SA) license, you must apply the same or a compatible license to any adaptation of the database you
share publicly.

In contrast to copyright, sui generis database rights are designed to
protect a maker’s substantial investment in a database. In particular, the
right prevents the unauthorized extraction and reuse of a substantial portion of the contents.
When a database is subject to sui generis database rights, extracting and
reusing a substantial portion of the database contents is prohibited
absent some express exception.
It is important to remember that sui generis database rights exist
in only a few countries outside the European
Union, such as Korea and Mexico. Generally, if you are using a CC-licensed
database in a location where those rights do not exist, you do not have to
comply with license restrictions or conditions unless copyright (or some other
licensed right) is implicated.
Note that if you are using a database in a jurisdiction where you must
respect database rights, and you receive a CC-licensed work from someone
located in a jurisdiction without database rights, you should determine whether
database rights exist and have been licensed. If so, you need to properly mark
and attribute as the license requires, since the person from whom you received
the database may not have been required to keep that information. If you are
using a licensed database and you do not have to comply with the license terms
because such rights do not exist in your jurisdiction, we recommend that you
retain this information where possible. Doing so assists downstream reusers who
are required to provide it when they share further.
There is no bright line test for what constitutes a “substantial portion”.
The answer will depend on the law in the relevant jurisdiction. Note that what
constitutes a substantial portion is determined both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Also, using several insubstantial portions can add up to a
substantial portion.

If the database is released under the current version (4.0) of CC licenses,
you must attribute the licensor if you share a substantial portion of the database contents. The other
requirements depend on the particular license applied to the database. Under
the NC licenses, you may not extract and reuse a substantial portion of the
database contents for commercial
purposes. The ND licenses prohibit you from including a substantial portion
of the database contents in another publicly shared database in which you have
sui generis database rights of your own. And finally, the SA licenses require
you to apply the same or a compatible license to any database you share publicly and
in which you include a substantial portion of the licensed database contents.
Note that this does not require you to ShareAlike any
copyright or other rights you have in the individual contents of the
database.

The licenses grant permission for reuse in any situation that requires
permission under copyright. There are many ways in which CC-licensed work works
and even all rights reserved works can be reused without permission. This
includes uses
that are fair uses, for example.
If someone uses a CC-licensed work with any new or developing technology,
and if copyright permission is required, then the CC license allows that use
without the need to seek permission from the copyright owner so long as the
license conditions are respected. This is one of the enduring qualities of our
licenses — they have been carefully designed to work with all new technologies
where copyright comes into play. No special or explicit permission regarding
new technologies from a copyright perspective is required.
CC’s copyright licenses are not universal policy tools. Copyright is the
primary obstacle to reuse that our licenses solve, but there are many other
issues related to the reuse of content that our licenses do not address and
that reusers should be aware of. These can include privacy
and rules governing ethical research and the collection or use of data, which
have to be addressed and respected separate and apart from the copyright issues
that CC licenses cover.
It depends. First, keep in mind that CC licenses never limit uses that
copyright doesn’t control. For example, as a general matter text and data
mining in the United States is considered a fair use and does not require
permission under copyright. This means that reusers engaged in text and data
mining do not have to adhere to the marking and attribution requirements in our
licenses for that activity even though we strongly recommend they do so anyway.
A second example is linking. In some countries, linking to copyrighted content
doesn’t require permission under copyright law, which means the CC license
obligations do not come into play even though the linked content is
CC-licensed.
Where a CC-licensed work is distributed as part of a database or dataset,
and assuming copyright (or in the European Union, copyright or sui generis
database rights) is triggered, then the license conditions must be respected.
This means providing the required attribution information in a way that is
reasonable under the circumstances. Our licenses allow for some flexibility,
and in some cases that may be as simple as providing a link to the website
where the relevant attribution information is provided. Visit our marking
practices page for more information.
This depends on whether any of the uses made of the works by the company,
whether for profit or non profit, are primarily intended for commercial
advantage or monetary compensation. This is hard to know without having all of
the facts about how a work was used, whether internally by the company for its
own purposes or how the work was distributed for further use. Visit our NC
page for more information about what constitutes commercial and non
commercial uses of works.
If NC-licensed content is redistributed to the public under an NC license,
that distribution would not violate the NC clause. (Note that CC strongly
discourages the use of any license terms other than a CC NC license for
redistributions of NC-licensed content.)
CC licenses never require a reuser of a CC-licensed work to make the
original work or resulting works (collections, derivatives, etc.) publicly
available. There are lots of private reuses of works that are permitted by CC’s
licenses that do not require compliance with their terms. Regarding ShareAlike,
the condition only applies if a work is modified and if the work is shared
publicly. In the situation where a reuser created a dataset of photos and made
it publicly available, and assuming copyright permission is required, then what
is released is likely a collection or compilation of pre-existing works. CC
licenses do not require the collection or the compilation itself to be made
available under an SA license, even though each individual work is still
licensed individually under an SA license and if they were modified by the
distributor the modified photo would need to be licensed under the same terms.
For example, were Creative Commons to compile photographs from a photo sharing
website under a BY-SA 2.0 license and create a database that it then publicly
distributed, CC could license the collection as a whole under a BY license, but
the photographs would continue to be licensed under BY-SA 2.0.
Several remedies are potentially available. Some may be available if the CC
license terms have been violated, and others may be available through other,
separate avenues because they involve other laws or regulations that the CC
licenses do not cover. It’s important to remember, however, that absent a
violation of the license the permissions granted under the license
remain in place and cannot be revoked.
An important starting point for any would-be sharer of content under a CC
license is to educate yourself in advance about how they work and what rights
they do and do not cover. We have many FAQs on our website. We also
provide human-readable
deeds with links to the full text of our
licenses. Additionally, all of our licenses highlight at the beginning many
considerations
that licensors should have in mind before they license, and considerations
for reusers
of works before they do so in order to avoid inadvertent violations.

You are free to subscribe to our newsletter. Our newsletter informs you regularly about the most recent vouchers, discount codes or other online saving opportunities for various product categories such as fashion, travel and/or electronics in connection with deals published on the websites of Global Savings Group (Global-savings-group.com). Your email address will only be passed to third parties, if you have given your express consent to do so in order to receive newsletters about certain products or services of these third parties.
When subscribing to our newsletter we will ask you to enter your email address in the registration mask. We will use such data solely to provide you with our newsletter.
When you subscribe to our newsletter, your IP address and the date and time of the registration will also be automatically stored on our servers. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the email address of a user at a later date, and it therefore serves us to prove that our registration process is in line with legal requirements.
After you have submitted your newsletter request, we will send a confirmation email to the given email address. This confirmation email contains a link that you need to click on to confirm your subscription. This so-called double-opt-in-procedure helps us to ensure that the email-account holder has actually authorised the receipt of our newsletter.
We use technical service providers which help us managing the newsletter subscriptions and providing related marketing services (âNewsletter Service Providersâ). This includes service providers which may have their registered seat and servers in a state outside of the European Union e.g. in the USA. However, we exclusively work with companies that offer an appropriate data protection level in line with the stipulations of the GDPR. You can find further information relating to the sharing of data to third parties outside of the European Union underÂ Section 11.4.
Currently we work with the following Newsletter Service Providers:
Our Newsletter Service Provider will process your email addresses and other personal data as described in section 5.3 as our data processor only on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions to help us evaluate the usage of our newsletter, to personalize your newsletter communications, to compile reports on newsletter activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to the usage of our newsletter. Our Newsletter Service Providers are in no way authorised to use the data of our newsletter subscribers in order to contact them themselves or to forward the data to third parties.
We will track and evaluate your usage of our newsletter, such as email-opens and email-clicks, by means of a tracking technology made available by the Newsletter Service Provider. For this purpose the HTML-emails sent with our newsletter may contain web beacons (also called pixel tags, tracking pixel or GIFs), automatically embedded by our Newsletter Service Providers. A web beacon is a small graphic that contains unique identifiers that allow an analysis of the success or failure of our Newsletter campaigns. Our Service Provider records each subscribers email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click in order to provide us with aggregated reports about how an email campaign performed and what actions subscribers took.
As part of your registration, we may ask for your consent to tailor the content of our newsletter to your personal interests. This is done by evaluating the data about your interactions with our newsletter and your use of this Website. That means that the pseudonymous Usage Data, we collected about you in the past and we will collect in the future will be attributed to your email address. This single record helps us to understand your needs and preferences even better so that we can adjust the contents of the newsletter optimally to your personal interests and to provide you with relevant content. We only combine your data as described and provide you with personalized content, if we have your express consent to do so.
The wording of your consent declaration given when subscribing for our newsletter can be viewed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
We will retain your personal data for the stated purposes as long as your subscription to our newsletter is active. You may cancel your newsletter subscription and withdraw your consent in that regard at any time either via the link provided at the bottom of each newsletter or by sending an email to: datenschutz@cuponation.com.
If you merely would like to opt-out of the newsletter tracking you may configure your email program in a way that emails are presented in text form instead of HTML format. This way the web beacons will not be able to work. You can also configure your browser settings in a way that no cookies are stored on your computer. Web beacons typically only work in conjunction with cookies. However, in these cases the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full and you may not be able to use all functions.
From time to time you may have the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests, raffles or similar promotional activities (âPromotional Activitiesâ) through this Website. We typically ask you for certain personal data in order for you to participate in such Promotional Activities, such as your name, surname, age, address, phone number, social media account, consumer behaviour and/or email address. We collect this information solely to administer the respective Promotional Activity (e.g. to verify your eligibility, to determine the winner and to present the award and/or to publish the winnerÂ´s name on this Website), unless you have given your explicit consent to use such data for specified other purposes. All Promotional Activities conducted via this Website are subject to the terms and conditions of each individual Promotional Activity. Such terms and conditions may provide additional information related to the processing of your personal data. Unless expressly otherwise specified, personal data collected by us in respect of Promotional Activities will not be stored any longer than is required to fulfill the purpose of the respective Promotional Activity.
As we finance ourselves through commissions, we may receive information from our business partners (e.g. merchants) about your online purchases, which you may place on websites of third parties (e.g. online-shops) after a visit to this Website. Such information is transmitted to us automatically with the help of tracking cookies. We never receive information that can directly identify you but merely commission related information such as the value of your purchase and date and time of the transaction. We also work with several so-called affiliate networks (âAffiliate Networksâ), which connect us with merchants and take over the technical and billing process. In these cases we receive the respective information from such Affiliate Networks. We solely use this information for billing purposes.
Under certain circumstances our business partners offer you the possibility to redeem vouchers for goods or services offered on their website. If you have created a shopping basket but have not checked-out yet, and subsequently call this Website, some business partners may share information regarding your open shopping basket (for example purchase value and product category). For this purpose we and our respective business partners use a technology (DoubleClick for Publishers) provided by Google Inc. This technology enables us to tailor and display vouchers on this website based on the content of your shopping basket. This form of advertising is carried out completely automatically and does not allow us to draw any conclusions about your identity. We can merely stipulate general criteria of the segmentation, such as product categories, on the basis of which certain vouchers are issued. For detailed information on Google DoubleClick for Publishers and how to prevent the processing of your data by Google, please seeÂ Section 10.2.
When you first visit this Website, we will inform you about the use of cookies and similar technologies served through this website and ask for your consent to the use of such cookies.

We may implement so called plug-ins (âPluginsâ) from social networks ( âSocial Networksâ) and other platforms ( âPlatformsâ) on certain webpages of this Website such as âShareâ or âLikeâ buttons, video player or interactive maps. We use such Plugins in order to give you the possibility to share or recommend interesting offers in Social Networks, to use interactive maps on our Website or to watch videos and to promote our services.
You may find the following Plugins on this Website:
The Plugins can be clearly identified as they feature the logo of the associated Social Network/Platform (e.g. white âfâ on blue background for Facebook).
The integration of Plugins enables the respective Social Network or Platform to collect data about you as you access a website that contains the respective Plugin. Your browser will establish a direct connection to the servers of the respective Social Network/Platform. We have no influence on the extent of the data collected by these Social Networks/Platforms via the Plugins. If you visit a website that contains a Plugin while you are logged in with the corresponding Social Network/Platform, the provider of such Social Network/Platform will be able to correlate your account data with information about your visit to the respective website (including your IP address). This information is transmitted directly to the servers of the respective providers. In addition information you intended to share with Social Networks will be published and shown to your contacts on these Social Networks. For further information, please refer to the privacy policy of the respective Social Networks and Platforms.

Cwtch (/kÊtÊ/ - a Welsh word roughly translating to âa hug that creates a safe placeâ) is a decentralized, privacy-preserving,
          multi-party messaging protocol that can be used to build metadata resistant applications.
Participants in Cwtch can host their own safe spaces, or lend their infrastructure to others
          seeking a safe space.  There is no âCwtch serviceâ or âCwtch networkâ. The Cwtch protocol is open, and anyone is free to build bots, services and user interfaces
          and integrate and interact with Cwtch.
All communication in Cwtch is end-to-end encrypted and takes place over Tor v3 onion services.
Cwtch has been designed such that no information is exchanged or available to anyone without their explicit consent, including on-the-wire messages and protocol metadata.
Existing secure messengers provide end to end encryption so that eavesdroppers can't see the contents of the communication.
                    But these centralized platforms, much like a post office, act as clearing houses for messages.
                  
They need access to metadata about your activities such as who you talk to, when and how much in order to offer features like group messaging and offline delivery.
Communications metadata is known to be exploited by many adversaries to undermine the security of systems; to track people;
                    And to conduct large scale social networking analysis that feeds into mass surveillance systems.
                    These systems have grave consequences for freedom, autonomy and sometimes...even life itself.
Cwtch is a metadata resistant privacy platform designed to hide this metadata and help you resist surveillance.
                  
Like other systems, Cwtch uses end to end encryption.

                    but the journey its messages take is different. Cwtch is a decentralized peer to peer platform built on Tor onion services.

                    With no need for a centralized server to route messages through, and onion routing provided by Tor, Cwtch establishes direct connections between peers while minimizing and sometimes even eliminating the metadata that 3rd parties can see.

                    Cwtch uses cryptographic identifiers that anyone can anonymously generate for themselves as many times as they want. This means they can't be tied to your real world identity by anyone but you.
Cwtch is designed to put consent first. This means we never want the app to do something you don't expect or want. Cwtch gives more control over what information is shared, how and who can communicate with who. We'll never included unsolicited content such as advertising or trends.

                    Cwtch is designed for people who need to protect, not only the *content* of their communication, but *who* they are talking to as well.

                    Cwtch provides a safe space for you and your friends, family, comrades, and fellow rabble-rousers.
                  
Cwtch is decentralized and focused on metadata-privacy in addition to communications privacy. Unlike other communication platforms,
        none of your messages are routed through a centralized server that has access to metadata such as your social network of friends, or
        who sent and received a particular message.
      
Even in experimental group chats which do rely on a routing server, the server learns no information about which messages belong
      to which group, who is a member of which group, or who messages are intended for.
 We believe that our tools should help people resist surveillance.  Communications metadata is known to be exploited by many adversaries to undermine the security of systems; to track people;
        and to conduct large scale social networking analysis that feeds into mass surveillance systems. And because of that, we explicitly
        designed Cwtch for metadata privacy.      
Like "kutch", to rhyme with "butch".
Cwtch peer-to-peer connections allow 2 people to message each other directly. Behind the scenes peer-to-peer connections
      use Tor v3 onion services to provide an encrypted, and metadata resistant connection. Because of this direct connection, both parties need
      to be online at the same time in order to message each other.
Cwtch Groups allow multiple parties to participate in a single conversation using an untrusted server (that can be provided by 3rd party or
      self hosted). Server operators cannot learn how many people are in a group, or what is being discussed. If multiple groups are hosted on a
      single server then the server is unable to learn which messages belong to which group without the collusion of a group member. Unlike in peer-to-peer
      conversations, group conversations can be conducted asynchronously, so everyone in a group doesn't need to be online at the same time.
Metadata-resistant group messaging is still an open problem. While the version we provide in Cwtch Beta is designed to be secure and metadata
      private it is rather inefficient and can be misused. As such we advise caution when using it, and only provide it as an opt-in feature.
Unlike a traditional centralized service that can offer password overrides, Cwtch stores all your data locally on your device.
Without the password, and the encrypted file, it is practically impossible for anyone to derive the key to decrypt the profile. As such that profile should be considered
      irretrievably lost.
The reference implementation for a Cwtch server is open source. Anyone
        can run a Cwtch server, and anyone with a copy of the server key bundle of public keys can host groups on that server
        without the operator having access to group related metadata.
At startup Cwtch launches a Tor process so that it can setup and connect to v3 onion services.
All Cwtch activity takes place through these onion services, and are reliant on Tor, we setup Cwtch in a background
        service that can be managed by Androids lifecycle management and can be reconnected to the foreground
        application when it is unpaused, or restarted.
Without this background process management Cwtch would require Tor to be reinitialized
        every time the app is loaded which would make it slow to start, and would make peer connection unusable on Android, as everytime the app went away you would go offline.
Note: Group connections are synchronized every time cwtch is online and it is not necessary to be online all the time when using them.
When a Tor process is running it will download some amount of data in order to retrieve consensus from the Tor network.
        Any active onion services will also require a small amount of data to maintain their circuits and introduction points independent of any app use.
In the future we plan to allow cwtch clients to opt-in to using an external Tor connection such as Orbot to manage Tor processes
      separately from Cwtch.
The front-pane of the app has a "Shutdown Cwtch" button (with an 'X') icon. Pressing this button will trigger a dialog, and on confirmation
      Cwtch will be shutdown and all profiles will be unloaded.
For information on the libraries, protocol, threat model and open questions please check out the Cwtch Security Handbook.

Bank-grade security for your Bitcoin.
Cold storage security with online ease.
Hidden Wallet can never access your keys or Bitcoin.
Each time you transfer bitcoins to your Hidden Wallet, they are mixed for extra security.
That "anonymity" is easily destroyed when you deal with Bitcoin Exchanges for example, which know your real identity.
Most of the Bitcoin Exchange services comply with AML and KYC policies so it's really hard to be anonymous to government agencies when dealing with bitcoins.
Hidden Wallet helps you break that chain, since it's hosted on Tor, noone knows who you are because we don't comply to any AML or KYC policies, so we can't be forced to reveal our users informations.
Even if we wanted to do that, we don't have much information about our users because they are using Tor.
We mix all your bitcoins, which makes tracing you impossible.
When using Bitcoin together with Tor you are combining the best online currency with the best encryption and privacy technology available.
When you're using normal internet websites to manage your bitcoin funds you can't know who's tracing you.
Only a shared Web Wallet on Tor will provide you with maximum anonymity and privacy.
Launder your Bitcoins for free, all we charge is the network fee of 0.001 BTC which we fully pay to the network.
To mix your bitcoins it's best to use a Tor hidden service like Hidden Wallet because clearweb operating mixers such as BitcoinFog are subject to government control.

Australia's premier soccer competition has been branded a 'village' after an A-League team's hapless attempt at scoring a goal went viral last weekend.
Star winger Josh Nisbet has been hammered on social media after failing to break his goal-scoring drought for the 2023/24 season in a series of mind-boggling bungles against Melbourne Victory.
Despite appearing fatigued, the Central Coast midfielder had a clear opportunity to double his team's lead during 1-0 win at AAMI Park on Sunday.Â 
The 24-year-old found himself with an open shot on goal but somehow failed to score not once, but twice very late in the match.
It came in a tense contest that saw three players red carded, with Victory landing a chance to salvage a draw deep into injury time.
Melbourne called their goalie into their attack in a last-ditch effort to equalise, but when that play failed, Nisbet had an open goal to attack.Â 
What happened next was borderline comical.Â 
Seriously, how did the ball not go in here?! ð¤¯â½ï¸Josh Nisbet's wait for a first goal of the season goes on, but he won't know how after this incredible pair of chances in the dying moments at AAMI Park!Report and highlights ð° https://t.co/4U4rROME3C #MVCvCCM pic.twitter.com/qFFH5Wvljl
Josh Nisbet (centre) has been in sublime form for the Central Coast Mariners this season but found himself going viral after missing two wide-open chances against Melbourne Victory
Nisbet had two golden opportunities from right in front but could not capitalise late in the match as fatigue set in
The ball landed perfectly for Nisbet, who had an unobstructed path to the goal from 30 metres out.
'The Mariners are away here. Paul Izzo is out of his goal!' Channel 10's Simon Hill said in commentary.
'Josh Nisbet just has to keep his head here.'
Despite dribbling effortlessly to the six-yard box, his attempt to score was blocked by Victory's Jake Brimmer.Â 
Nisbet's initial right-foot shot was thwarted, and then subsequent rebound hit the top bar.
Despite the blunder, the Mariners secured their first-ever win over Victory at AAMI Park.Â 
However, the social media world doesn't forget, and a clip of Nisbet's miss has been viewed more than 200,000 times, overshadowing the team's victory in online discussions.
'It's not match-fixing, it's pure unwillingness and inability,' one fan fired at the shocking series of goal fumbles.
Josh Nisbetâs saucy AFC Cup assist for Angel Torres is ðð¯ðð§ ððð­ð­ðð« from the reverse angle ð¤¤ð¥ðWhat a pass. What a player ð´ð¥@CCMariners #ALM pic.twitter.com/mfdRSnn2Ix
A Josh Nisbet appreciation post âï¸How good was Nizzy last night?! An incredible assist while running the game for 120 minutes! ð¥Performances don't get much better ð#CCMFC #BeOurMate pic.twitter.com/wLa4rSwLKg
'Words can't express how atrocious that play was from Nisbet. He had a million opportunities to score and as is typical A-League talent, he took a thousand touches and waited till the defence was there till he shot,' posted another.
'How did Josh Nisbet not score at the death? Seriously, that shows the lack of talent throughout the A-League,' another commenter wrote.
'Nisbet should get a red for that,' fumed another A-League fan.
Cruelly for Nisbet, the dual failures mean he remains goalless for the season.
It comes just after he received the PFA Player of the Month award for January. He was leading the league for assists at the time.Â 
'I'm honoured to get this award. it's voted by peers and opposition so it's great that they think I'm doing really well this season,' Nisbet said.Â 
'I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the team and the club, we are doing so well at the moment and I wouldn't be able to do it without them.Â 
Former A-Leagues defender Robbie Cornthwaite called for Nisbet to be called up into Graham Arnold's Socceroos squad in 2023 and despite the viral moments against Victory, he remains one of the A-League's best players.

Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, Daniel Winzen can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on my website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow me, as previously mentioned, to recognize my website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize my website. An example for the use of a cookie is when you log in to the mail client, the cookie assures that you stay logged in with your account until closing your browser or logging out.
This site makes only use of technically necessary session cookies and does not use any form of tracking cookies.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through my website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of my website may be entirely usable.
The server of Daniel Winzen collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website or other provided services. This general data and information is stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches my website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site / email transmission, (6) sender and recipient of an email, and (7) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on my information technology systems.
When using these general data and information, Daniel Winzen does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of my website and services correctly, (2) optimize my services, (3) ensure the long-term viability of my information technology systems and website technology. Therefore, I may analyze anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of my services, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data I process. The general data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject for up to 48 hours and are then permanently deleted.
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely erased in accordance with legal requirements.
Each data subject shall have the right of confirmation and access according to Article 15 GDPR, Right to rectification according to Article 16 GDPR, Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) according to Article 17 GDPR, Right of restriction of processing according to Article 18 GDPR, Right to data portability according to GDPR article 20, Right to object according to Article 21 GDPR
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which I obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary to provide services, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning my services. If I am subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the above-mentioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by me or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
Legally binding is only the English version of this privacy policy

Strava is a social network for serious-yet-amateur athletes. Itâs also a vertical social network with some powerful characteristics:
I believe thereâs an opportunity for a vertical social network built for serious-yet-amateur home cooks. Initial target users would be fans of influencers like J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt, Binging with Babish and Alex French Guy Cooking. (All of their audiences have significantly increased during COVID.)
Similar to Strava, youâd start by offering single-player tools. For Strava thatâs been route planning and segments; for cooking that might be a database of web-crawled recipes with a Gantt chart interface to manage the timing of a multi-course meal. As a user base develops, youâd start adding in multiplayer social features.
There are plenty of ways you could monetize. Affiliate links are one avenue (cookbooks, kitchen equipment). Paid subscriptions (pro features in app, weekly recipes from celebrity chefs) is another.
At-scale, Strava for cooking would become the go-to place for cooking inspiration, recipes, videos, kitchen equipment, and internet socializing about food.
This idea originally appeared in RFS 100. Thereâs some additional feedback on the Strava for X concept here.

For privacy, please use PGP mail encryption, if you can. This prevents others from reading your mails to protect your privacy. You can download GnuPG or similar software for it. Once you have generated your PGP key, you can add it to your account to make use of WKD automatic discovery for mail clients.
You can choose between two Web-Mail clients installed on the server. SquirrelMail is a very old mail client which works without any JavaScript and is thus the most popular mail client among darknet users. However, it hasn't been under development for many years and does not support all features that mail has to offer. You may see strange attachments that should have been inlined in your email, such as PGP/MIME encrypted email messages. A more modern client is SnappyMail, which also supports PGP encryption within your browser and is more similar to what you may be used to from other mail services. SnappyMail requires JavaScript though, so SquirrelMail is for you if you do not trust executing JavaScript in your browser. Alternatively, you can simply use your favourite desktop mail client and configure it with the settings given below.

License information
This page presents the opinion of some debian-legal contributors on how
certain licenses follow the
Debian Free Software
Guidelines (DFSG). Most of these opinions were formed in
discussions on the debian-legal mailing list in response to questions from
potential package maintainers or licensors. We welcome
enquiries from maintainers considering particular licenses, but
we encourage most maintainers to use one of the common licenses:
GPL, LGPL, modified BSD, or Artistic.
Software packaged for Debian is normally classified into one of four
categories. There is free software (main), non-free software and firmware
(non-free, non-free-firmware), free software which depends on some non-free
software (contrib) and software which cannot be redistributed
(not included).
Debian Policy section 2
explains exactly how the DFSG
are applied to the archive. If in doubt, maintainers are
asked to email debian-legal about licenses, including the text
of any new license into the body of the email.
You may find it helpful to
search the list archives
for the name of the license before emailing lists with questions
about it. If you still email questions, please link to some of
the previous relevant discussions.
debian-legal is advisory. The actual decision-makers are the
ftpmasters and the package maintainers. However, if one cannot
convince most of the generally liberal debian-legal contributors,
it's probably not clear that the software follows the DFSG.
Because the actual decision-makers are the
ftpmasters and the package maintainers, it is a very good idea
to check
the ftpmasters REJECT FAQ
and search site:packages.debian.org for any license that you doubt,
to look for other examples of its handling for debian.
(The search works because package copyright files are published on
packages.debian.org as plain text.)
Other lists are maintained by the
Free Software

dino

                    Dino is a modern open-source chat client for the desktop. It focuses on providing a clean
                    and reliable Jabber/XMPP experience while having your privacy in mind.
                

Download now »
New: Dino 0.4 Release »

Dino is secure by default: Your chats never leave your computer unencrypted. Once you
                    enabled end-to-end encryption via OMEMO or OpenPGP,
                    only you and your chat partners can read your messages, but not your server administrator or anyone
                    else.
                
If you want to increase your privacy, Dino allows you to disable read and typing
                    notifications â globally or only for specific contacts.

                    Being free and open-source software, anyone can inspect and modify Dino. This means that you don't
                    have to trust a single company or development team.
                

                    Dino is developed on GitHub by an open community where
                    everyone can contribute â by creating a bug report, translating Dino into
                    their language or making a pull request.
                
Dino is built on the XMPP protocol, an internet standard for
                    decentralized communication â the instant messaging pendant to email.
Decentralization means you don't have to rely on a single provider or company, instead
                    you can use a federated world-wide infrastructure. You can even host your own server!
You can get Dino from the repositories of many Linux distributions.
                
Dino 0.4 is released! ðï¸ Dino now supports message reactions and replies. Furthermore, we switched to GTK4 and libadwaita. #dino #xmpp Release blog post: https://dino.im/blog/2023/02/dino-0.4-release/
Dino 0.3 is released and supports video calls and conferences! ð¥³ You can call a friend or a group of people. Calls are e2e-encrypted, peer-to-peer and compatible with other XMPP applications. Release blog post: https://dino.im/blog/2022/02/dino-0.3-release/
Video calls in Dino are slowly coming together. We are already making successful OMEMO encrypted video calls! The feature is included in our nightly builds now, but there's still further work to be done. #dino #xmpp
XMPP is an open standard for communication, mainly used for instant messaging. It is a
                    secure battle-tested protocol developed by an independent standards organization.
The "X" in XMPP stands for "Extensible", which means the core
                    protocol is updated and extended with more features through a transparent process at the non-profit
                    XMPP Standards Foundation every
                    now and then. This results in some clients not implementing every feature of XMPP; for example, a
                    typical instant messaging client won't implement Internet-of-Things functionality. Dino supports the
                    most important standard extensions (XEP) for a modern chat client*.  You can see an excerpt of the list of supported XEPs on the right.
                
* It is compliant with the official XMPP
                    Compliance Suites 2020.

Introduction
To honour the memory of Simon Greenberg, a former Mail on Sunday reporter, who died aged 52 in 2021, a new bursary and scholarship programme is being established with the support of DMGT to identify and develop an exciting new generation of sports news journalists.
 
Who is the bursary for?
The scheme would look to help those from diverse and less advantaged backgrounds who might otherwise not be able to afford to pay for post graduate journalism training. Successful candidates will need to demonstrate a passion and understanding of sport (especially football) across multi platforms and be able to explain what they read/watch/listen to. It can be newspapers, websites, podcasts, video â or all of them. It would be advantageous if they are across Mail Sportâs products â the sports pages of the newspaper, the social channels, the podcasts, the website.
 
How will the scheme work?
Working in conjunction with the long standing National Council for the Training of Journalistsâ (NCTJ) Journalism Diversity Fund (JDF), one successful applicant will be selected to enter the programme. The chosen candidate will be given the opportunity to study an NCTJ approved postgraduate training course with their fees and living expenses covered by a specially created bursary. It is envisaged that their training will include work experience on the sports desks of our titles.
 
About the successful candidate?
We are looking for someone who has a passion for sport and an interest in learning what it takes to be a successful sports journalist. Ideally you will have basic social and video editing skills and someone who is ambitious, has a hunger for success and naturally inquisitive.
 
What happens at the end of the training?
On the successful completion of the studentâs training, they will be offered a 12 month fixed term contract with DMGT which would include rotations through the sports departments of DMGTâs titles.

My days tend to be quite varied (which I like) one day Iâll be planning and putting together email, ppc or social marketing strategies or looking at how we can optimise our user journeys, another day might be more data focussed, building reports and dashboards and using them to understand our users better and justify marketing decisions. Sometimes I might be researching our competitors and thinking of ways to improve our proposition, overall, itâs a role that requires lots of different skills.
What I really like is our approach to work, which is very much test and learn. Everything we do is ultimately to learn more about our subscribers so we can provide them with the best possible experience. We have a small team, each are experts in their individual areas which is great as you can learn so much from one another. Similarly, as we work across brands itâs great that we can share learnings.
As MailOnline’s Director of Web Development, I lead teams of backend and frontend software engineers to achieve the vision the business has for the MailOnline websites and their surrounding ecosystem, being ultimately responsible for their architecture, keeping best practices, and hiring, nurturing, and keeping the right developers, as well as helping shape the overall technical strategy.
The thing I like most about working for dmg:media and the MailOnline in particular is the sheer scale of our audience – everything we build not only has a very quick turnaround, but also reaches hundreds of millions of people. Our team is full of very talented, hard working, good people, and it is a pleasure to work with them. Finally, quality is a top concern, and I know in the end I’ll be proud of the work we put out, with everyone working together to reach ever higher standards.

It looks like Tesla owners who were hoping to play Cyberpunk in their Cybertruck are going to be disappointed as the electric pickup truckâs computer doesnât support Steam gaming, at least based on how the company has rolled out the streaming video game option in the Model S and Model X.
Tesla launched Steam gaming to their flagship Model S and Model X vehicles late in 2022, but not for all of them. Despite the refresh Model S and Model X having been around for over a year at the time, the computer in earlier builds featured less RAM and storage, with only newer builds having the required 16GB RAM and 256GB storage capacity.In the lead up to Tesla starting deliveries of the Cybertruck, everyone was expecting it to also have Steam integration, giving it is the companyâs latest vehicle with the latest technology, including a massive 18.5â³ screen, the largest Tesla has included in one of their vehicles. However, Steam has so far not been mentioned on any of Teslaâs marketing materials, and not appeared in any customer-owned Cybertrucks. As it turns out, that is because Tesla appears to be going down the same road with the Cybertruck as they did with the Model S/X.According to hacker @greentheonly on X, the specs of the Cybertruck computer matches that of the early Model S/X builds, in that it only has 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. Another reason Steam has not appeared is that the Cybertruck might not have a discrete GPU (dGPU), something else that Tesla requires for Steam integration, although green said he was unsure on this point.Regardless, green points out that unless Tesla relaxes their requirements (16GB RAM, 256GB storage) for Steam gaming, there will be no Cyberpunk, or any of the other thousands of games on the Steam platform, in your Cybertruck.This naturally brings up the question of retrofits. When it was pointed out that early Model S/X did not have the required specs for Steam, Elon Musk said on X that retrofits would be made available. This should mean that if Tesla ever starts building the Cybertruck with Steam-capable hardware, retrofits will also be available, but they wonât be cheap as it costs around US$2,300 to retrofit Model S/X.Here are greenâs other findings on the Cybertruck, including that its front display has a resolution of 2560Ã1440, larger than the 2200Ã1300 in the Model S/X like we mentioned above. Additionally, the resolution of the rear screen is 1440Ã900, also better than the Model S/X which have the same size screen but are software-limited to 1280Ã720.While Steam support is part of the firmware, same as S/X, it's not showing up for anybody with CT because today the car computer is roughly same spec as modern 3/y and original S/X refresh: only 8G RAM, 128G storage.dGPU presence unclear (probably not there?)â green (@greentheonly) February 26, 2024Are you buying a Tesla?

Additionally, the resolution of the rear screen is 1440Ã900, also better than the Model S/X which have the same size screen but are software-limited to 1280Ã720.While Steam support is part of the firmware, same as S/X, it's not showing up for anybody with CT because today the car computer is roughly same spec as modern 3/y and original S/X refresh: only 8G RAM, 128G storage.dGPU presence unclear (probably not there?)â green (@greentheonly) February 26, 2024Are you buying a Tesla?

Regardless, green points out that unless Tesla relaxes their requirements (16GB RAM, 256GB storage) for Steam gaming, there will be no Cyberpunk, or any of the other thousands of games on the Steam platform, in your Cybertruck.

2024 will see many elections throughout the world, but also European elections. We will soon have a new set of Members of the European Parliament and new decision-makers in the European Commission.

Good news for whistleblowers, journalists, and everyone who likes to browse the Internet with an added cloak of privacy: the Tor network got a little stronger. Torâsoftware that lets you mask your IP addressârelies on an international network of committed volunteers to run relays to help mask traffic. And that network is stronger now, thanks to the 1,000+ volunteers who participated in our second-ever Tor Challenge.
The goal of the Tor Challenge is simple: to improve the Tor network by inspiring people to run relays. These relays are the backbone of the Tor network; they're the machines that actually forward and anonymize Tor users' communications. We also see this Challenge as an opportunity to educate people about the value of Tor, address common misconceptions about Tor, and give technically oriented folks a concrete, somewhat measurable way of promoting freedom and privacy online.
This is the second time weâve held this challenge, and the outpouring of support from the technical community far exceeded our hopes. When launching this campaign in June, we were hoping to surpass 549 participating relaysâthe total number of relays that took part in the challenge in 2011. And that was an ambitious number; 2011 was during the Arab Spring, and the EFF Tor Challenge was one small way that technologists could lend support to democratic activists who relied on Tor to organize and reach the larger Web. We hoped that this year weâd be able to inspire just as much participation.
The results far outstripped our hopes: we had nearly three times as many participating relays. Thatâs over 1,600 relaysâeither new or increased in bandwidthâhelping to strengthen the Tor network.
Hereâs a breakdown of the results:
One of the reasons this campaign was so successful was that we teamed up with three other organizations: the Free Software Foundation, Freedom of the Press Foundation, and the Tor Project. These organizationsâ promotional efforts were key to the campaignâs success.
The other key? Over 1,000 individuals who cared enough to help contribute bandwidth to the Tor network. Our gratitude goes out to each of the participants. Thanks for making the Internet a little more private and a bit more resistant to censorship.
Special thanks to Dr. Karsten Loesing of the Tor Project for making these awesome graphs of the challenge.

El fabricante chino de coches Chery estÃ¡ cada vez mÃ¡s cerca de desembarcar en las instalaciones de la antigua Nissan en la Zona Franca de Barcelona. SegÃºn han confirmado fuentes del sector a CincoDÃ­as, la compaÃ±Ã­a asiÃ¡tica, a travÃ©s de EV Motors (dueÃ±a de BTech, una de las dos compaÃ±Ã­as que conforman el D-Hub, el cual ganÃ³ la licitaciÃ³n para la reindustrializaciÃ³n de la antigua Nissan) encargÃ³ a fines de diciembre una lÃ­nea de ensamblaje para su Omoda 5 elÃ©ctrico al grupo Loafa, una compaÃ±Ã­a que tambiÃ©n tiene de clientes a las plantas de Volkswagen Navarra y Seat Martorell (Barcelona). El contrato fue de 1,5 millones de euros para una lÃ­nea de ensamblaje que puede montar hasta ocho vehÃ­culos a la vez de unidades DKD. Esto quiere decir que lo vehÃ­culos vendrÃ¡n semiensamblados para su montaje final en dicha lÃ­nea, en la cual Chery tambiÃ©n puede hacer los Tiggo 8 y 9, dos modelos SUV de una marca que todavÃ­a no ha lanzado en EspaÃ±a.
EV Motors y Chery llevan meses negociando la llegada de la compaÃ±Ã­a china a la Zona Franca de Barcelona. Aunque ninguna de las dos empresas da por cerrado aÃºn el acuerdo, fuentes del sector consideran que âes un hechoâ y que la automovilÃ­stica china arribarÃ¡ a Barcelona para salvar un proyecto de reindustrializaciÃ³n que estaba en serio riesgo de encallar por la incapacidad de BTech y QEV (el otro socio del D-Hub) para llenar de vehÃ­culos la vieja Nissan. BTech planea revivir la antigua marca Ebro para vender pickups y furgonetas elÃ©ctricas (basadas en la estructura de la Nissan Navara y la NV200, respectivamente), pero no estÃ¡ previsto que comience a comercializarlas hasta el aÃ±o que viene; mientras que QEV lanzÃ³ su marca de vehÃ­culo industrial y furgonetas Zeroid, de la que apenas tiene pedidos aÃºn. De esta Ãºltima llegÃ³ un primer envÃ­o desde China de 44 unidades DKD al puerto de Barcelona para ensamblar en la antigua Nissan, segÃºn adelantÃ³ La Tribuna de AutomociÃ³n y confirmÃ³ este periÃ³dico.
Fuentes sindicales explican que, incluso en el caso de que los proyectos de QEV y BTech tengan Ã©xito, es clave la llegada de Chery para dar empleo en el corto plazo. Actualmente, el D-Hub tiene en torno a 730 personas en plantilla, 606 de ellas con un contrato de formaciÃ³n y el resto con un contrato de trabajo ordinario. AdemÃ¡s de las 44 unidades mencionadas, QEV traerÃ¡ a Barcelona otras 200 unidades DKD en una primera fase para llegar a un total de 1.000 a final de aÃ±o. Estas furgonetas se venderÃ¡n a Bimbo, que le hizo un encargo de 1.500 furgonetas elÃ©ctricas Zeroid.
La semana pasada, el vicepresidente del grupo Chery, Charlie Zhang, afirmÃ³ en un encuentro con un reducido grupo de periodistas que la compaÃ±Ã­a es âoptimistaâ en relaciÃ³n a la instalaciÃ³n de producciÃ³n en Barcelona y que, en caso de llegar, emplearÃ­a a un mÃ­nimo de 1.000 personas. âHay muchas opciones, estamos tratando de dar lo mejor para tener un negocio viable en tÃ©rminos de producciÃ³n local en EspaÃ±aâ, dijo Zhang, que dejÃ³ en claro que tambiÃ©n analizan otras posibilidades.
Efe informÃ³ el domingo que Chery y EV Motors estudian la posibilidad de crear una joint venture para que Chery produzca tres vehÃ­culos elÃ©ctricos de la marca Ebro, ademÃ¡s de la pickup y la furgoneta mencionadas anteriormente. Como muestra de que las conversaciones entre ambas son continuas, una delegaciÃ³n de EV Motors se encuentra esta semana en China para celebrar reuniones de âcarÃ¡cter tÃ©cnicoâ para informarse en profundidad de los detalles de los vehÃ­culos que Chery harÃ­a en Barcelona. Por su parte, el ministro de Industria y Turismo, Jordi Hereu, se mostrÃ³ confiado este lunes en que las negociaciones lleguen a buen puerto. âLas conversaciones avanzan y espero que en semanas o en poco tiempo tengamos confirmadas buenas noticias para afianzar este gran centro. Tenemos gente muy formada que viene de una tradiciÃ³n larga y tenemos el ecosistema perfecto, con proveedores y demÃ¡sâ, indicÃ³ Hereu a Efe.
El fabricante automovilÃ­stico chino celebrÃ³ la presentaciÃ³n oficial de su marca Omoda la semana pasada en un evento en Madrid. AllÃ­, mostrÃ³ el Omoda 5 de combustiÃ³n que venderÃ¡ desde 27.900 euros sin descuentos. La versiÃ³n elÃ©ctrica, que serÃ­a la que la compaÃ±Ã­a ensamblarÃ­a en esta primera lÃ­nea de montaje en Barcelona, llegarÃ¡ al mercado espaÃ±ol antes de verano con un precio inferior a los 40.000 euros sin ayudas, con el nombre de Omoda E5. Zhang asegurÃ³ la semana pasada que la compaÃ±Ã­a podrÃ­a hacer tanto elÃ©ctricos como vehÃ­culos de combustiÃ³n en Barcelona.
La compaÃ±Ã­a realizÃ³ a fines del aÃ±o pasado su primer envÃ­o con 700 vehÃ­culos al puerto de Barcelona, entre los que habÃ­a tambiÃ©n unidades del Jaecoo 7, que comenzarÃ¡ su venta oficial en el segundo cuatrimestre de este aÃ±o y contarÃ¡ con versiones de combustiÃ³n e hÃ­brida enchufable. En el Ãºltimo cuatrimestre de este aÃ±o, la compaÃ±Ã­a pondrÃ¡ a la venta el Omoda 9, un SUV grande de 4,8 metros de largo con versiÃ³n hÃ­brida enchufable. Por Ãºltimo, en 2025, llegarÃ¡ el Jaecoo 8, tambiÃ©n en versiÃ³n hÃ­brida enchufable.

Las tecnologÃ­as de inteligencia artificial (IA) han emergido con fuerza durante los Ãºltimos aÃ±os llegando a convertirse en el foco de acaloradas discusiones no solo en el Ã¡mbito tecnolÃ³gico, sino tambiÃ©n polÃ­tico, acadÃ©mico, filosÃ³fico y la esfera pÃºblica en su conjunto. Las promesas de mejora y progreso que se atribuyen a la IA se entremezclan con las preocupaciones que generan los posibles riesgos que estas tecnologÃ­as pueden producir tanto a escala individual como en el conjunto de la ciudadanÃ­a y los sistemas democrÃ¡ticos.[1]
Aunque estos debates son Ãºtiles y sin duda necesarios, casi todos ellos asumen 1) que la adopciÃ³n de la IA es inevitable y 2) que estas tecnologÃ­as son neutrales y sus efectos nocivos o beneficiosos dependen del uso que se haga de ellas. En este artÃ­culo abordamos brevemente tres grupos de problemas Ã©ticos âprivacidad, autonomÃ­a humana y libertad; sesgos, discriminaciÃ³n e igualdad; y crisis ecosocialâ que surgen en torno a la IA y que, de distinto modo, ponen de relieve como estas tecnologÃ­as, lejos de ser neutrales, son inherentemente polÃ­ticas y, por tanto, su adopciÃ³n responde a un compromiso con ciertos proyectos ideolÃ³gicos[2]. Desde esta perspectiva la IA no es un conjunto de tecnologÃ­as neutrales, sino una industria que se vale de la extracciÃ³n y explotaciÃ³n no solo de los recursos naturales, sino tambiÃ©n de nuestros datos y nuestros cuerpos.
Privacidad, autonomÃ­a humana y libertad. Una de las componentes esenciales que necesita cualquier sistema de IA para poder funcionar son los datos. Los datos son la informaciÃ³n, la experiencia si usamos una metÃ¡fora humana, de la que se nutren los algoritmos (los sistemas de reglas) que permiten que la IA funcione. Grosso modo, podrÃ­amos decir que los algoritmos aprenden de los datos a extraer las relaciones y los resultados mÃ¡s probables. Identifica patrones que se encuentran presentes en los datos y asÃ­ puede hacer estimaciones precisas. Por este y otros motivos la recopilaciÃ³n de datos es una prÃ¡ctica que tiene lugar diariamente de forma masiva y que nos afecta a todos.
En este contexto, muchos planteamientos Ã©ticos vinculados a la recopilaciÃ³n explotaciÃ³n y uso de los datos se plantean en relaciÃ³n con los problemas que estas prÃ¡cticas pueden suponer, primero, para la privacidad. Los datos que se recopilan a travÃ©s de nuestros relojes inteligentes, el consumo de pelÃ­culas y plataformas en streaming, etc, pueden contener y eventualmente revelar informaciÃ³n extremadamente privada sobre nuestras vida como nuestra orientaciÃ³n sexual[3], nuestras prÃ¡cticas sexuales, nuestra vida sentimental, familiar, y muchas otras cuestiones que con casi toda seguridad no compartirÃ­amos con una persona de poca confianza y, aÃºn menos con un extraÃ±o[4].
Pero los problemas relacionados con los datos tambiÃ©n pueden producir problemas en relaciÃ³n con la autonomÃ­a humana y la libertad individual. En relaciÃ³n con la autonomÃ­a humana el problema se encuentra relacionado con la pÃ©rdida de la capacidad para pensar y tomar decisiones por nosotros mismos en una sociedad donde el uso de algoritmos de IA es cada vez mayor. Pensemos que cuando Netflix o cualquier plataforma de streaming nos hace una recomendaciÃ³n sobre quÃ© pelÃ­cula o serie podrÃ­amos ver, casi automÃ¡ticamente desaparece un abanico entero de posibles contenidos que podrÃ­amos haber elegido si hubiÃ©ramos sido nosotros los que hubiÃ©ramos hecho la selecciÃ³n. El problema aquÃ­ no es tanto que la recomendaciÃ³n en base a nuestras elecciones previas, sino nuestra predisposiciÃ³n a mantenernos dentro de las pelÃ­culas seleccionadas por el algoritmo.
En el caso de las plataformas de streaming esto puede ser algo anecdÃ³tico, pero Â¿quÃ© sucederÃ­a si este tipo de sistemas se usaran para recomendarnos que nuevos productos disponibles en el supermercado nos gustarÃ¡n mÃ¡s en base a nuestras preferencias alimenticias? Â¿Y si las recomendaciones fueran sobre quÃ© carrera estudiar, quÃ© universidad elegir, dÃ³nde veranear o con quiÃ©n tenemos mÃ¡s posibilidades de construir una relaciÃ³n sentimental duradera? Nuestra tendencia no solo a considerar, sino en muchos casos a adoptar las recomendaciones de la tecnologÃ­a puede resultar muy problemÃ¡tica si el nÃºmero de Ã¡mbitos en los que estas actÃºan aumenta. Aunque seamos nosotros los que creemos tener la Ãºltima palabra, lo cierto es que este tipo de recomendaciones acotan nuestro rango de actuaciÃ³n y en muchos casos eliminan siquiera la posibilidad de plantearnos otras preferencias, caminos y/o alternativas que rompan con ese sendero que los algoritmos marcan a partir de nuestros gustos previos.
AdemÃ¡s de la pÃ©rdida de autonomÃ­a humana, la recopilaciÃ³n y uso masivo de datos tambiÃ©n puede afectar a la libertad individual. En la tradiciÃ³n liberal que predomina en los paÃ­ses occidentales la libertad se entiende como la ausencia de interferencia para actuar de la forma que nosotros consideramos mÃ¡s adecuada siempre y cuando esta se mantenga dentro de los lÃ­mites que permiten la convivencia dentro de una comunidad polÃ­tica[5][6]. Para ejemplificar como la IA afecta a esta idea de libertad normalmente se recurre al uso que hace China de estas tecnologÃ­as. El sistema de crÃ©dito social chino funciona a travÃ©s de la recopilaciÃ³n de ingentes cantidades de datos sobre sus ciudadanos para sancionarlos o premiarlos en funciÃ³n de cÃ³mo de âcÃ­vicaâ haya sido su conducta. AsÃ­, por ejemplo, a los ciudadanos que hayan acumulado una serie de faltas, como ausencias a citas mÃ©dicas o cruzar la calle con un semÃ¡foro en rojo, puede llegar a prohibirles realizar vuelos internacionales[7]. En este sentido, resulta evidente como ciertas formas de uso de nuestros datos puede entrar en conflicto con la libertad individual de las personas.
Aunque en Europa este tipo de sistemas estarÃ¡n prohibidos segÃºn la regulaciÃ³n de IA[8], cabrÃ­a preguntarse hasta quÃ© punto, por ejemplo, el uso de sistemas de IA para determinar a quÃ© personas se les otorga un crÃ©dito bancario y a quiÃ©nes se les deniega, controlar las fronteras, otorgar visados, etc., constituyen o no actos contrarios a la libertad. Si atendemos a otras formas de entender la libertad que se salgan del marco del liberalismo como, por ejemplo, la que se maneja dentro del marco del republicanismo donde la libertad no se entiende con relaciÃ³n al individuo, sino a la comunidad en su conjunto[9], entonces encontramos que es posible que los sistemas de IA preserven la libertad individual, es decir, no interfieran en nuestra vida, y, sin embargo, no nos permitan ser ciudadanos libres[10].
El concepto de libertad como no dominaciÃ³n que opera en el seno del republicanismo muestra cÃ³mo, a ojos del liberalismo, un esclavo podrÃ­a ser considerado libre si tuviera un amo muy bueno que le permitiese hacer lo que quisiera. El hecho de que el esclavo elija sus actos no le hace menos esclavo, pues siempre se encuentra bajo el control de su amo. En este sentido, el republicanismo y sus versiones contemporÃ¡neas ofrecen unas nuevas lentes con las que problematizar la IA y ser mÃ¡s crÃ­ticos con estas tecnologÃ­as. Estas reflexiones apuntan a que aÃºn en aquellas circunstancias en las que la IA no llegase a interferir directamente en nuestra vida, el hecho de que estas tecnologÃ­as se materialicen en todos los Ã¡mbitos de nuestra vida convierte a las empresas que recopilan nuestros datos en dueÃ±os de nuestras vidas. En el capitalismo de la vigilancia en el que son otros los que disponen de nuestros datos y los que eligen cÃ³mo y cuÃ¡ndo usarlos, nosotros, la ciudadanÃ­a, dejamos de ser libres[11].
Sesgos, discriminaciÃ³n e igualdad. En relaciÃ³n con los datos no solo importa cuÃ¡ntos datos se recopilen. TambiÃ©n hay problemas Ã©ticos que surgen en funciÃ³n del tipo de datos que se usen para nutrir los sistemas IA. Como mencionÃ¡bamos en el apartado anterior la IA aprende de los datos con los que se le entrena, principalmente, buscando patrones de repeticiÃ³n que le permitan identificar las relaciones mÃ¡s probables en funciÃ³n de la frecuencia. El entrenamiento y uso de datos de mala calidad y poco representativos en el caso de la IA puede producir problemas de discriminaciÃ³n y, por tanto, resultados que generan situaciones incompatibles con la justicia entendida en tÃ©rminos de igualdad[12].
Los problemas de discriminaciÃ³n en la IA pueden tomar distinta forma y se pueden deber a cuestiones de raza, etnia, gÃ©nero, clase social, religiÃ³n, lenguaje, etc[13]. Estos problemas se producen cuando los datos de los que se nutren los sistemas de IA no son representativos y, al contrario, tiende a sobrerrepresentar a unos colectivos frente a otros. En la medida que la IA, como sucede de manera generalizada en el Ã¡mbito cientÃ­fico-tecnolÃ³gico, es marcadamente androcÃ©ntrica los datos suelen representar con mayor frecuencia a los hombres blancos antes que a cualquier otro grupo de personas. AsÃ­, desde que estas tecnologÃ­as han empezado a operar entre nosotros se han ido descubriendo este tipo de sesgos que generan discriminaciÃ³n.
Para ilustrar esta problemÃ¡tica podemos usar el ejemplo del sistema IA que hace unos aÃ±os puso en marcha Amazon para optimizar su proceso de selecciÃ³n de personal y elegir a los mejores candidatos para un puesto[14]. Sin embargo, al poco tiempo de tener en funcionamiento este sistema, la compaÃ±Ã­a se dio cuenta de que a los currÃ­culums de mujeres se les asignaba, de manera sistemÃ¡tica, una puntuaciÃ³n mÃ¡s baja que a la de los hombres. Tras analizar quÃ© estaba sucediendo descubrieron que en los datos con los que se habÃ­a entrenado al algoritmo, que procedÃ­an de los procesos de selecciÃ³n de personal de la empresa durante los 10 aÃ±os anteriores, habÃ­a una desproporcionada presencia de hombres. Esto provocÃ³ que el algoritmo encontrase un patrÃ³n de repeticiÃ³n claro: si en el pasado mÃ¡s hombres se habÃ­an presentado para ocupar un puesto y habÃ­an sido seleccionados, entonces debe ser que ellos son mÃ¡s aptos para ese cargo. De este modo que cuando esta IA se puso en funcionamiento empezÃ³ a tomar la variable âhombreâ como algo positivo, tal y como podrÃ­a haber sido el tener mÃ¡s aÃ±os de experiencia en un puesto similar o una formaciÃ³n especializada en el Ã¡rea de contrataciÃ³n.
Como hemos seÃ±alado antes, los sesgos tambiÃ©n pueden producirse por cuestiones de raza. El proyecto Gender Shades analizÃ³ tres sistemas de reconocimiento facial y demostrÃ³ como los rostros de personas negras eran identificados con menos precisiÃ³n que los de personas blancas de manera sistemÃ¡tica. Uno de los sistemas, desarrollado por Microsoft, identificaba correctamente el 100% de las caras de hombres blancos, en el caso de los hombres negros el porcentaje de aciertos era del 94%. Las cifras de IBM eran incluso peores, frente al 99,7% de hombres blancos correctamente identificados el de hombres negros era del 88%. Si al color de la piel le sumamos la variable del gÃ©nero, entonces la diferencia es aÃºn mayor. Frente al 100% de hombres blanco bien identificados por el sistema de Microsoft, este solo acertaba con el 79,2% de las mujeres negras. En el caso de IBM la diferencia era del 99,7% para los hombres blancos al 65,3% para las mujeres negras.
Estos y otros ejemplos muestran como la IA estÃ¡ sesgada en distintos sentidos, produce situaciones discriminatorias y evidencia de falta de neutralidad. Estos problemas no son fallos o errores puntuales que se den en la tecnologÃ­a, sino que son el resultado de una forma de pensar, entender y hacer ciencia y tecnologÃ­a desde presupuestos marcadamente androcÃ©ntricos y blancos. La IA, como el resto de las tecnologÃ­as, ha sido (y continÃºa siendo) imaginada, diseÃ±ada y usada no solo en el marco de un sistema patriarcal, sino tambiÃ©n capitalista en el que la norma, el dato estÃ¡ndar, es el del hombre blanco occidental. Esta realidad que permea las estructuras de la IA, y todas las disciplinas cientÃ­fico-tÃ©cnicas, son el verdadero motivo de las sistemÃ¡ticas discriminaciones y situaciones de desigualdad producidas por la tecnologÃ­a y evidencia que estas son indisociables de proyectos ideolÃ³gicos, asÃ­ como ciertos contextos polÃ­ticos y sociales. Si buscamos construir sociedades justas en la que todos los ciudadanos y ciudadanas sean libres e iguales, entonces deberÃ­a ser una prioridad no solo acabar con los sesgos, sino cuestionar el proyecto actual de IA. La tarea por delante no es sencilla, la igualdad en la IA no solo depende del uso de bases de datos que representen en igualdad de condiciones a los colectivos que se verÃ¡n afectados por sus decisiones y/o recomendaciones, tambiÃ©n implica revisar los propios fundamentos tecnolÃ³gicos, cientÃ­ficos, polÃ­ticos, econÃ³micos y sociales que han permitido que la IA surja con tanta fuerza y amenace con convertirse en un ser omnipresente en nuestra sociedad.
Crisis ecosocial. Desde finales del s. XX las tecnologÃ­as digitales han sido presentadas como radicalmente contrarias a las tecnologÃ­as industriales de la primera y la segunda revoluciÃ³n industrial y, por tanto, como limpias, respetuosas con el medioambiente, casi independientes de infraestructura y normalmente asociadas a trabajos de gran valor social que necesitan de alta cualificaciÃ³n. AsÃ­ lo reflejan los distintos discursos sobre tecnologÃ­as como la IA que se encuentran plagados de metÃ¡foras ecolÃ³gicas como âla nubeâ, âredes neuronalesâ, âmontaÃ±as de datosâ, âgranjas de datosâ, etc., que nos hacen relacionar estas tecnologÃ­as con el respeto a la naturaleza y un futuro verde[15]. MetÃ¡foras que tratan de ocultar una realidad muy distinta: que la IA, lejos de ser un ente casi etÃ©reo similar a una nube, es tan material y contaminante como una mina.
De la mina proceden los materiales que se necesitan para fabricar las tecnologÃ­as de IA. Materiales como el cobre, el nÃ­quel, el litio, las tierras raras, etc., se han convertido en elementos esenciales cuya extracciÃ³n genera un impacto ecolÃ³gico tremendo y su apropiaciÃ³n, conflictos geopolÃ­ticos serios. Y es que, por un lado, buena parte de estos materiales crÃ­ticos, tambiÃ©n conocidos como CRM[16], se encuentran en suelo chino y ruso, asÃ­ como en otros paÃ­ses como Brasil, India, Chile, Bolivia, etc. Solo una pequeÃ±a parte de ellos se encuentra en territorio europeo. Por otro lado, las prÃ¡cticas de extracciÃ³n asociadas a la minerÃ­a producen erosiÃ³n, pÃ©rdida de biodiversidad, devastaciÃ³n de la vegetaciÃ³n cercana, contaminaciÃ³n de las aguas, deforestaciÃ³n, etc. AdemÃ¡s, la minerÃ­a, el refinamiento de materiales, la manufactura fuera de Europa, etc., suele estar vinculada a unas condiciones laborales pÃ©simas para los trabajadores implicados[17].
Una vez se dispone de los materiales adecuados y estos son manufacturados su transporte a Europa tambiÃ©n produce un impacto ecolÃ³gico importante. En 2017, el transporte a travÃ©s de barcos mercantes, utilizados, entre otros fines, para transportar los productos y las tecnologÃ­as de IA, fue responsable del 3,1% de las emisiones globales de CO2, lo que supera, por ejemplo, las emisiones producidas por un paÃ­s como Alemania[18]. Asimismo, los cables submarinos a travÃ©s de los cuales se transmite gran parte de la informaciÃ³n que necesita la IA para funcionar producen un impacto medioambiental muy alto y son una realidad normalmente opacada al hablar de IA.
La minerÃ­a, el refinamiento, la manufacturaciÃ³n y el transporte ponen de relieve que lejos de ser realidades no contaminantes, la IA es un grupo de tecnologÃ­as que necesita de una amplÃ­sima infraestructura (mucho mayor que la de las tecnologÃ­as industriales) para funcionar. Una infraestructura que se extiende tambiÃ©n dentro de las fronteras europeas. Los centros de datos donde se almacena la informaciÃ³n ânuestros datosâ que usa la IA tambiÃ©n son realidades materiales que permanecen con frecuencia ocultas y que, sin embargo, consumen una gran cantidad de energÃ­a. En el aÃ±o 2018, los centros de datos europeos consumieron el 2,7% de la energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica producida en la UE y las predicciones mÃ¡s optimistas, en el caso de que las ganancias en eficiencia energÃ©tica crezcan al mismo ritmo que el consumo, estiman que este alcance el 3,21% en 2030. En el caso de que eficiencia y consumo no vayan de la mano este Ãºltimo podrÃ­a alcanzar el 6%[19].
Y es que, ya en 2011, si la computaciÃ³n en la nube fuera considerado un paÃ­s, esta serÃ­a el sexto paÃ­s del mundo que mÃ¡s energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica demanda[20]. Entre 2012 y 2014 la industria de las tecnologÃ­as de la comunicaciÃ³n y la informaciÃ³n (TIC) consumiÃ³ tanta energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica como el tercer paÃ­s mÃ¡s contaminante del mundo, solo detrÃ¡s de EEUU y China[21]. TambiÃ©n el entrenamiento de algoritmos como ChatGPT y otros grandes modelos de lenguaje consume grandes cantidades de energÃ­a que suelen ser pasadas por alto. Se estima que entrenar a ChatGPT-3 ha Â«generado 500 toneladas de CO2, el equivalente a ir y volver a la Luna en cocheÂ»[22]. AdemÃ¡s, Â«el uso que se habrÃ­a hecho de electricidad en enero de 2023 en OpenAI, la empresa responsable de ChatGPT, podrÃ­a equivaler al uso anual de unas 175.000 familias danesasÂ»[23], aunque se apunta que estas familias no son las que mÃ¡s consumen en Europa.
Finalmente, el reciclaje de los desechos electrÃ³nicos que se derivan del uso masivo de tecnologÃ­a, entre ellas las de IA, no es todavÃ­a una prÃ¡ctica totalmente extendida en la UE. Gran parte de estos desechos se trasladan a paÃ­ses como Ghana o PakistÃ¡n donde son acumulados produciendo un deterioro del entorno y las especies que lo habitan a travÃ©s de la acidificaciÃ³n de las aguas, la expulsiÃ³n de gases tÃ³xicos, la pÃ©rdida de biodiversidad, etc. Esta realidad pone de relieve una forma de funcionamiento de la IA muy distinta a la narrativa de los datos y los algoritmos que solemos escuchar. Al contrario, plantea serias dudas sobre si los discursos polÃ­ticos, econÃ³micos y acadÃ©micos quÃ© presentan a la IA como una aliada fundamental para luchar contra el cambio climÃ¡tico estÃ¡n o no en lo cierto y si esta no sirve mÃ¡s bien para hacer greenwashing y seguir justificando y legitimando el consumo ilimitado en Occidente sin importar el impacto socioecolÃ³gico que ello implique.
Los problemas Ã©ticos que hemos expuesto en este texto son solo algunos de los que surgen en torno al diseÃ±o, adopciÃ³n y uso de estas tecnologÃ­as[24]. La elecciÃ³n de estos y no otros se debe a que apuntan a problemas de fondo asociados el proyecto de IA en su conjunto, no a una simple enumeraciÃ³n de debates Ã©ticos que parten de la asunciÃ³n de que dicho proyecto es bueno y/o deseable en sÃ­ mismo. El impacto socioecolÃ³gico de la IA, junto a sus implicaciones para la libertad, las mujeres y otros colectivos vulnerables, pone de relieve que estas tecnologÃ­as son mucho mÃ¡s que sistemas enfocados a tomar decisiones iguales o mejores que las humanas, sino que mÃ¡s bien constituyen una idea, una forma de entender y ejercer el poder, una infraestructura y una industria extractivista de nuestros de recursos naturales, nuestros datos y nuestros cuerpos. En este sentido, la reflexiÃ³n Ã©tica y polÃ­tica sobre la IA nunca deberÃ­a limitarse a asumir los marcos tecnooptimistas que se nos imponen dentro del capitalismo y, mÃ¡s bien, deberÃ­a a apuntar hacia como construir futuros ecolÃ³gicos y socialmente justos en los que la tecnologÃ­a no sea la Ãºnica soluciÃ³n a nuestros problemas y la vÃ­a preferencial hacia el progreso.

Long read: Who is qualified to make a world?
In search of the magic of maps.
Squeeze the trigger.
Call of Duty: Warzone's Season Two download is now live - and it's a big one.
Here are the download sizes:
When I started the download on my PS5 this morning, I was warned over 100GB of clear space was required before I could start the 17GB update, forcing me to delete games installed on my hard-drive.
After I deleted some games, the 17GB Modern Warfare download began.
It's really annoying to have to find so much space for a 17GB download, particularly so given there's currently no way to move PS5 games off the SSD.
Storage is an issue Activision addressed overnight, warning that those who own a standard PS4 with a default hard-drive of 500GB (that's me!) may need to make room if they have the full versions of Modern Warfare, Warzone and Black Ops Cold War with all modes and packs installed.
This means that for the first time Activision is warning that all three games installed to their fullest and up to date with Season Two will not fit on a standard PS4 any more.
"Should you have both games installed and have kept up to date with updates, you may need to delete some unused game content to have a successful download and install of the Warzone patch tonight," Activision said.
You can uninstall parts of Black Ops Cold War and Modern Warfare to save space, but it's a landmark moment that shows just how big Call of Duty install footprints have become.

        A new EU regulation could undermine the trust we have in secure and confidential processes like sending work emails, communicating with our doctors, and even governments, Ella Jakubowska writes.
    
A new law is threatening the privacy of the European Unionâs 447 million inhabitants.
The CSA Regulation, proposed byÂ European Commissioner Ylva Johansson, could undermine the trust we have in secure and confidential processes like sending work emails, communicating with our doctors, and even governments protecting intelligence.
The regulation wants to routinely scan our private communications online using AI tools to look for the spread of child sexual abuse material.Â 
It does not matter if you are suspected of a crime or not, this scanning could include everyone â hundreds of millions of law-abiding European residents.
This EU home affairs law does not just propose to scan the words that we type. It also wants to scan the personal pictures on our phones, the documents on our clouds, and the contents of our emails.Â 
All the ways that we live our lives online, including a lot of deeply personal information, could be subject to regular digital searches.
Having anyone's legitimate conversations monitored will harm everyone, especially children. Experts show that no one will be protected by making the internet less secure.Â 
Mass surveillance online does not make us safer, it erodes our democratic rights and freedoms.
Research confirms that AI systems perpetuate discrimination. We see men of colour flagged as suspicious when they're not doing anything wrong.Â Women's and girls' bodies and LGBTQ+ people are over-censored.Â 
These technologies entrench structural racism, sexism, homophobia and inequality, meaning that certain people are over-targeted whilst others are erased.Â 
How can we trust this inherently faulty technology with such a sensitive issue as our childrenâs safety online?
Despite what the name suggests, AI tools arenât even particularly intelligent â at least not in the way that we commonly think of intelligence.Â 
They make mistakes that even a small child would not make. That does not mean that they cannot be useful, but we must be very careful about when it is â and is notÂ â appropriate to use them.
Under the new proposal, these biased, unreliable AI tools would predict whose messages, pictures or uploads contain child abuse.Â 
Based on what we know about AI and discrimination, it is likely that a Black man or a queer person, for example, would be more likely to be wrongfully flagged as a suspect and reported to the authorities.
AI detection inevitably flags a lot of innocent material. Cherished pictures of families on the beach or a snap of the kids in the bath sent to grandma.Â 
A selfie which was uploaded to your personal cloud. A message from a teenager to their older cousin asking for advice.Â 
None of this will be private any more.Â 
How do we know? Because these AI-based false reports are already happeningÂ â and at rates much higher than the new law claims.
According to the draft law, if you choose to use online apps or platforms that respect your privacy and personal data, it is more likely that your private communications will be routinely scanned.
Â âWhy would you want to protect your personal messages if you donât have anything to hideâ is the line of logic of the EUâs Home Affairs unit.
In a time of surveillance advertising, mass abuses of our personal data, and âBig Techâ platforms that hold more power than some governments, choosing chat and email providers that respect our privacy is the only smart choice.
Encrypted chat apps, for example, are one of the few tools we actually have that help us stay safe online.
Thatâs why downloads of the secure messenger app Signal increased ten-fold following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine.
The EU cannot breach our digital private lives "just in case" we are doing something wrong. This violates the most basic principles of how we organise as a society.
The EUâs Home Affairs chief, Ylva Johansson, says that this proposal is the only way that the EU can keep children safe online.Â 
Yet both the United Nations and UNICEF have already repeatedly warned against the generalised surveillance of young peopleâs internet use, confirming that it is harmful to children.
The EUâs data protection supervisor cautions that this law would put almost all EU internet users at risk, with very little evidence that it will stop child abuse.Â 
And in a landmark new survey, 80% of young people have stated that if their communications were routinely scanned, they would no longer feel safe being politically active or exploring their sexuality.
As anti-trafficking technology expert Anjana Rajan warns, secure communications tools are mostly used for legitimate purposes.Â 
The fact that a minority abuse them doesn't mean we should put everyone at greater risk.Â 
It means we need to do more to tackle those individuals through investments in child protection specialists, prevention, justice, education and better online reporting and user empowerment tools.Â 
Thatâs where the EU should be focusing its efforts.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2021/914
of 4Â June 2021
on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27Â April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)Â (1), and in particular ArticleÂ 28(7) and ArticleÂ 46(2)(c) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Technological developments are facilitating cross-border data flows necessary for the expansion of international cooperation and international trade. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is not undermined where personal data is transferred to third countries, including in cases of onward transfersÂ (2). The data transfer provisions in Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are intended to ensure the continuity of that high level of protection where personal data is transferred to a third countryÂ (3).
(2)
Pursuant to ArticleÂ 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in the absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission pursuant to ArticleÂ 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country only if it has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. Such safeguards may be provided for by standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission pursuant to ArticleÂ 46(2)(c).
(3)
The role of standard contractual clauses is limited to ensuring appropriate data protection safeguards for international data transfers. Therefore, the controller or processor transferring the personal data to a third country (the âdata exporterâ) and the controller or processor receiving the personal data (the âdata importerâ) are free to include those standard contractual clauses in a wider contract and to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard contractual clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects. Controllers and processors are encouraged to provide additional safeguards by means of contractual commitments that supplement the standard contractual clausesÂ (4). The use of the standard contractual clauses is without prejudice to any contractual obligations of the data exporter and/or importer to ensure respect for applicable privileges and immunities.
(4)
Beyond using standard contractual clauses to provide appropriate safeguards for transfers pursuant to ArticleÂ 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the data exporter has to fulfil its general responsibilities as controller or processor under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Those responsibilities include an obligation of the controller to provide data subjects with information about the fact that it intends to transfer their personal data to a third country pursuant to ArticleÂ 13(1)(f) and ArticleÂ 14(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the case of transfers pursuant to ArticleÂ 46 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such information must include a reference to the appropriate safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or information where they have been made available.
(5)
Commission Decisions 2001/497/ECÂ (5) andÂ 2010/87/EUÂ (6) contain standard contractual clauses to facilitate the transfer of personal data from a data controller established in the Union to a controller or processor established in a third country that does not offer an adequate level of protection. Those decisions were based on Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the CouncilÂ (7).
(6)
Pursuant to ArticleÂ 46(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Decision 2001/497/EC and Decision 2010/87/EU remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission decision adopted pursuant to ArticleÂ 46(2) of that Regulation. The standard contractual clauses in the decisions required updating in the light of new requirements in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Moreover, since the decisions were adopted, the digital economy has seen significant developments, with the widespread use of new and more complex processing operations often involving multiple data importers and exporters, long and complex processing chains, and evolving business relationships. This calls for modernisation of the standard contractual clauses to reflect those realities better, by covering additional processing and transfer situations, and to allow a more flexible approach, for example with respect to the number of parties able to join the contract.
(7)
A controller or processor may use the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision to provide appropriate safeguards within the meaning of ArticleÂ 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the transfer of personal data to a processor or controller established in a third country, without prejudice to the interpretation of the notion of international transfer in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The standard contractual clauses may be used for such transfers only to the extent that the processing by the importer does not fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. This also includes the transfer of personal data by a controller or processor not established in the Union, to the extent that the processing is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (pursuant to ArticleÂ 3(2) thereof), because it relates to the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the Union or the monitoring of their behaviour as far as it takes place within the Union.
(8)
Given the general alignment of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the CouncilÂ (8), it should be possible to use the standard contractual clauses also in the context of a contract, as referred to in ArticleÂ 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 for the transfer of personal data to a sub-processor in a third country by a processor that is not a Union institution or body, but which is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and which processes personal data on behalf of a Union institution or body in accordance with ArticleÂ 29 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Provided the contract reflects the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to ArticleÂ 29(3) Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular by providing sufficient guarantees for technical and organisational measures to ensure that the processing meets the requirements of that Regulation, this will ensure compliance with ArticleÂ 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In particular, that will be the case where the controller and processor use the standard contractual clauses in Commission Implementing Decision on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors under ArticleÂ 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council and ArticleÂ 29(7) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the CouncilÂ (9).
(9)
Where the processing involves data transfers from controllers subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to processors outside its territorial scope or from processors subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to sub-processors outside its territorial scope, the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision should also allow to fulfil the requirements of ArticleÂ 28(3) andÂ (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(10)
The standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision combine general clauses with a modular approach to cater for various transfer scenarios and the complexity of modern processing chains. In addition to the general clauses, controllers and processors should select the module applicable to their situation, so as to tailor their obligations under the standard contractual clauses to their role and responsibilities in relation to the data processing in question. It should be possible for more than two parties to adhere to the standard contractual clauses. Moreover, additional controllers and processors should be allowed to accede to the standard contractual clauses as data exporters or importers throughout the lifecycle of the contract of which they form a part.
(11)
In order to provide appropriate safeguards, the standard contractual clauses should ensure that the personal data transferred on that basis is afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the UnionÂ (10). With a view to ensuring transparency of processing, data subjects should be provided with a copy of the standard contractual clauses and be informed, in particular, of the categories of personal data processed, the right to obtain a copy of the standard contractual clauses, and any onward transfer. Onward transfers by the data importer to a third party in another third country should be allowed only if the third party accedes to the standard contractual clauses, if the continuity of protection is ensured otherwise, or in specific situations, such as on the basis of the explicit, informed consent of the data subject.
(12)
With some exceptions, in particular as regards certain obligations that exclusively concern the relationship between the data exporter and data importer, data subjects should be able to invoke, and where necessary enforce, the standard contractual clauses as third-party beneficiaries. Therefore, while the parties should be allowed to choose the law of one of the Member States as governing the standard contractual clauses, that law must allow for third-party beneficiary rights. In order to facilitate individual redress, the standard contractual clauses should require the data importer to inform data subjects of a contact point and to deal promptly with any complaints or requests. In the event of a dispute between the data importer and a data subject who invokes his or her rights as a third-party beneficiary, the data subject should be able to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority or refer the dispute to the competent courts in the EU.
(13)
In order to ensure effective enforcement, the data importer should be required to submit to the jurisdiction of such authority and courts, and to commit to abide by any binding decision under the applicable Member State law. In particular, the data importer should agree to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. In addition, the data importer should have the option of offering data subjects the opportunity to seek redress before an independent dispute resolution body, at no cost. In line with ArticleÂ 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data subjects should be allowed to be represented by associations or other bodies in disputes against the data importer if they so wish.
(14)
The standard contractual clauses should provide for rules on liability between the parties and with respect to data subjects, and rules on indemnification between the parties. Where the data subject suffers material or non-material damage as a consequence of any breach of the third-party beneficiary rights under the standard contractual clauses, he or she should be entitled to compensation. This should be without prejudice to any liability under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(15)
In the case of a transfer to a data importer acting as a processor or sub-processor, specific requirements should apply in accordance with ArticleÂ 28(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The standard contractual clauses should require the data importer to make available all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in the clauses and to allow for and contribute to audits of its processing activities by the data exporter. With respect to the engagement of any sub-processor by the data importer, in line with ArticleÂ 28(2) andÂ (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the standard contractual clauses should in particular set out the procedure for general or specific authorisation from the data exporter and the requirement for a written contract with the sub-processor ensuring the same level of protection as under the clauses.
(16)
It is appropriate to provide different safeguards in the standard contractual clauses that cover the specific situation of a transfer of personal data by a processor in the Union to its controller in a third country and reflect the limited self-standing obligations for processors under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In particular, the standard contractual clauses should require the processor to inform the controller if it is unable to follow its instructions, including if such instructions infringe Union data protection law, and require the controller to refrain from any actions that would prevent the processor from fulfilling its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. They should also require the parties to assist each other in responding to enquiries and requests from data subjects under the local law applicable to the data importer or, for data processing in the Union, under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Additional requirements to address any effects of the laws of the third country of destination on the controllerâs compliance with the clauses, in particular how to deal with binding requests from public authorities in the third country for disclosure of the transferred personal data, should apply where the Union processor combines the personal data received from the controller in the third country with personal data collected by the processor in the Union. Conversely, no such requirements are justified where the outsourcing merely involves the processing and transfer back of personal data that has been received from the controller and in any event has been and will remain subject to the jurisdiction of the third country in question.
(17)
The parties should be able to demonstrate compliance with the standard contractual clauses. In particular, the data importer should be required to keep appropriate documentation for the processing activities under its responsibility and to inform the data exporter promptly if it is unable to comply with the clauses, for whatever reason. In turn, the data exporter should suspend the transfer and, in particularly serious cases, have the right to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under standard contractual clauses, where the data importer is in breach of the clauses or unable to comply with them. Specific rules should apply where local laws affect compliance with the clauses. Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract, and any copies thereof, should at the choice of the data exporter be returned to the data exporter or destroyed in their entirety.
(18)
The standard contractual clauses should provide for specific safeguards, in particular in the light of the case law of the Court of JusticeÂ (11), to address any effects of the laws of the third country of destination on the data importerâs compliance with the clauses, in particular how to deal with binding requests from public authorities in that country for disclosure of the transferred personal data.
(19)
The transfer and processing of personal data under standard contractual clauses should not take place if the laws and practices of the third country of destination prevent the data importer from complying with the clauses. In this context, laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in ArticleÂ 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should not be considered as being in conflict with the standard contractual clauses. The parties should warrant that, at the time of agreeing to the standard contractual clauses, they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices applicable to the data importer are not in line with these requirements.
(20)
The parties should take account, in particular, of the specific circumstances of the transfer (such as the content and duration of the contract, the nature of the data to be transferred, the type of recipient, the purpose of the processing), the laws and practices of the third country of destination that are relevant in light of the circumstances of the transfer and any safeguards put in place to supplement those under the standard contractual clauses (including relevant contractual, technical and organisational measures applying to the transmission of personal data and its processing in the country of destination). As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with the standard contractual clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment, including reliable information on the application of the law in practice (such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies), the existence or absence of requests in the same sector and, under strict conditions, the documented practical experience of the data exporter and/or data importer.
(21)
The data importer should notify the data exporter if, after agreeing to the standard contractual clauses, it has reason to believe that it is not able to comply with the standard contractual clauses. If the data exporter receives such notification or otherwise becomes aware that the data importer is no longer able to comply with the standard contractual clauses, it should identify appropriate measures to address the situation, if necessary in consultation with the competent supervisory authority. Such measures may include supplementary measures adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer, such as technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality. The data exporter should be required to suspend the transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards can be ensured, or if so instructed by the competent supervisory authority.
(22)
Where possible, the data importer should notify the data exporter and the data subject if it receives a legally binding request from a public (including judicial) authority under the law of the country of destination for disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to the standard contractual clauses. Similarly, it should notify them if it becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to such personal data, in accordance with the law of the third country of destination. If, despite its best efforts, the data importer is not in a position to notify the data exporter and/or the data subject of specific disclosure requests, it should provide the data exporter with as much relevant information as possible on the requests. In addition, the data importer should provide the data exporter with aggregate information at regular intervals. The data importer should also be required to document any request for disclosure received and the response provided, and make that information available to the data exporter or the competent supervisory authority, or both, upon request. If, following a review of the legality of such a request under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the third country of destination, it should challenge it, including, where appropriate, by exhausting available possibilities of appeal. In any event, if the data importer is no longer able to comply with the standard contractual clauses, it should inform the data exporter accordingly, including where this is the consequence of a request for disclosure.
(23)
As stakeholder needs, technology and processing operations may change, the Commission should evaluate the operation of the standard contractual clauses in the light of experience, as part of the periodic evaluation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 referred to in ArticleÂ 97 of that Regulation.
(24)
Decision 2001/497/EC and Decision 2010/87/EU should be repealed three months after the entry into force of this Decision. During that period, data exporters and data importers should, for the purpose of ArticleÂ 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, still be able to use the standard contractual clauses set out in Decisions 2001/497/EC andÂ 2010/87/EU. For an additional period of 15 months, data exporters and data importers should, for the purpose of ArticleÂ 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, be able to continue to rely on standard contractual clauses set out in Decisions 2001/497/EC andÂ 2010/87/EU for the performance of contracts concluded between them before the date of repeal of those decisions, provided that the processing operations that are the subject matter of the contract remain unchanged and that reliance on the clauses ensures that the transfer of personal data is subject to appropriate safeguards within the meaning of ArticleÂ 46(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the event of relevant changes to the contract, the data exporter should be required to rely on a new ground for data transfers under the contract, in particular by replacing the existing standard contractual clauses with the standard contractual clauses set out in the Annex to this Decision. The same should apply to any sub-contracting to a (sub-)processor of processing operations covered by the contract.

SECTION II â OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

Clause 8


Data protection safeguards

The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.

MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller

8.1Â Â Â Purpose limitation

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B. It may only process the personal data for another purpose:
(i)
where it has obtained the data subjectâs prior consent;
(ii)
where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
(iii)
where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
8.2Â Â Â Transparency

(a)
In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:
(i)
of its identity and contact details;
(ii)
of the categories of personal data processed;
(iii)
of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses;
(iv)
where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.
(b)
Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.
(c)
On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.
(d)
Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 andÂ 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
8.3Â Â Â Accuracy and data minimisation

(a)
Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.
(b)
If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.
(c)
The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing.
8.4Â Â Â Storage limitation

The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisationÂ (2) of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.
8.5Â Â Â Security of processing

(a)
The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter âpersonal data breachâ). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.
(b)
The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
(c)
The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
(d)
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
(e)
In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13. Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.
(f)
In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.
(g)
The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.
8.6Â Â Â Sensitive data

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a personâs sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter âsensitive dataâ), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.
8.7Â Â Â Onward transfers

The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European UnionÂ (3) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter âonward transferâ) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module. Otherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if:
(i)
it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to ArticleÂ 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
(ii)
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
(iii)
the third party enters into a binding instrument with the data importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards to the data exporter;
(iv)
it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings;
(v)
it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or
(vi)
where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject.
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
8.8Â Â Â Processing under the authority of the data importer

The data importer shall ensure that any person acting under its authority, including a processor, processes the data only on its instructions.
8.9Â Â Â Documentation and compliance

(a)
Each Party shall be able to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation of the processing activities carried out under its responsibility.
(b)
The data importer shall make such documentation available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor

8.1Â Â Â Instructions

(a)
The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.
(b)
The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.
8.2Â Â Â Purpose limitation

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.
8.3Â Â Â Transparency

On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 andÂ 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
8.4Â Â Â Accuracy

If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.
8.5Â Â Â Duration of processing and erasure or return of data

Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
8.6Â Â Â Security of processing

(a)
The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter âpersonal data breachâ). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
(b)
The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
(c)
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
(d)
The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.
8.7Â Â Â Sensitive data

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a personâs sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter âsensitive dataâ), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.
8.8Â Â Â Onward transfers

The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European UnionÂ (4) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter âonward transferâ) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:
(i)
the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to ArticleÂ 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
(ii)
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
(iii)
the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
(iv)
the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
8.9Â Â Â Documentation and compliance

(a)
The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.
(b)
The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.
(c)
The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporterâs request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.
(d)
The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
(e)
The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor

8.1Â Â Â Instructions

(a)
The data exporter has informed the data importer that it acts as processor under the instructions of its controller(s), which the data exporter shall make available to the data importer prior to processing.
(b)
The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, and any additional documented instructions from the data exporter. Such additional instructions shall not conflict with the instructions from the controller. The controller or data exporter may give further documented instructions regarding the data processing throughout the duration of the contract.
(c)
The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions. Where the data importer is unable to follow the instructions from the controller, the data exporter shall immediately notify the controller.
(d)
The data exporter warrants that it has imposed the same data protection obligations on the data importer as set out in the contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law between the controller and the data exporterÂ (5).
8.2Â Â Â Purpose limitation

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B., unless on further instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, or from the data exporter.
8.3Â Â Â Transparency

On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.
8.4Â Â Â Accuracy

If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to rectify or erase the data.

Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
8.6Â Â Â Security of processing

(a)
The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter âpersonal data breachâ). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter or the controller. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
(b)
The data importer shall grant access to the data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract.

In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify, without undue delay, the data exporter and, where appropriate and feasible, the controller after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
(d)
The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify its controller so that the latter may in turn notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.
8.7Â Â Â Sensitive data

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a personâs sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter âsensitive dataâ), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards set out in Annex I.B.
8.8Â Â Â Onward transfers

The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European UnionÂ (6) (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter âonward transferâ) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:
(i)
the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to ArticleÂ 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
(ii)
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
(iii)
the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
(iv)
the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.

MODULE FOUR: Transfer processor to controller
(where the EU processor combines the personal data received from the third country-controller with personal data collected by the processor in the EU)

(a)
The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in ArticleÂ 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.
(b)
The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:
(i)
the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;
(ii)
the laws and practices of the third country of destinationâ including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities â relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguardsÂ (12);
(iii)
any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.
(c)
The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.

The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
(e)
The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). [For Module Three: The data exporter shall forward the notification to the controller.]
(f)
Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation [for Module Three:, if appropriate in consultation with the controller]. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by [for Module Three: the controller or] the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.

The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).
(b)
The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. [For Module Three: The data exporter shall make the assessment available to the controller.]
(c)
The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.
SECTION IV â FINAL PROVISIONS

Clause 16


Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination

(a)
The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.
(b)
In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
(c)
The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:
(i)
the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
(ii)
the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
(iii)
the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.
In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority [for Module Three: and the controller] of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
(d)
[For Modules One, Two and Three: Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data.] [For Module Four: Personal data collected by the data exporter in the EU that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall immediately be deleted in its entirety, including any copy thereof.] The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
(e)
Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to ArticleÂ 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Clause 18


Choice of forum and jurisdiction


MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller


MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor


MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor

(a)
Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.
(b)
The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of _____ (specify Member State).
(c)
A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.
(d)
The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.

MODULE FOUR: Transfer processor to controller

Â 
Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of _____ (specify country).

(1)Â Â Where the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with ArticleÂ 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23Â October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) NoÂ 45/2001 and Decision NoÂ 1247/2002/EC (OJ LÂ 295, 21.11.2018, p.Â 39), to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to ArticleÂ 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision 2021/915.

(2)Â Â This requires rendering the data anonymous in such a way that the individual is no longer identifiable by anyone, in line with recital 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and that this process is irreversible.

(3)Â Â The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Unionâs internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.

(4)Â Â The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Unionâs internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.

(5)Â Â See ArticleÂ 28(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, where the controller is an EU institution or body, ArticleÂ 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

(6)Â Â The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Unionâs internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purposes of these Clauses.

(7)Â Â This includes whether the transfer and further processing involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a personâs sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences.

(8)Â Â This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.

(9)Â Â This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.

(10)Â Â That period may be extended by a maximum of two more months, to the extent necessary taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The data importer shall duly and promptly inform the data subject of any such extension.

(11)Â Â The data importer may offer independent dispute resolution through an arbitration body only if it is established in a country that has ratified the New York Convention on Enforcement of Arbitration Awards.

(12)Â Â As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.
APPENDIX

Watch Dogs: Legion segna un punto di svolta importante per la saga degli "hacktivisti" di Ubisoft, una deviazione che scarta il canone "dell'eroe solitario" per metterci alla guida di un gruppo di ribelli presi - letteralmente - dalla strada, che assieme puntano a strappare Londra dalle grinfie di un misterioso tiranno informatico. La possibilitÃ  di interpretare uno qualsiasi dei cittadini della capitale britannica rappresenta una sfida importante per il publisher francese, figlia di un concept ambizioso modellato per cambiare le regole di una formula open world che ha ormai fatto il suo tempo. Purtroppo l'obiettivo Ã¨ stato raggiunto solo in parte: Legion Ã¨ un titolo ricco di idee interessanti, che perÃ² fatica a scrollarsi di dosso i difetti storici di questo genere di produzioni.
Watch Dogs: Legion accoglie i giocatori tra le maglie di una distopia dal sapore familiare, proiezione poligonale delle estreme conseguenze di una digitalizzazione pervasiva e inarrestabile, che ha portato i cittadini di Londra ad indossare volontariamente le catene di un nuovo totalitarismo informatizzato. Tra luci al neon della "Swinging City" 2.0 serpeggiano le lunghe ombre di chi vuole convertire la rete in uno strumento di controllo, in una gabbia orwelliana fatta di bit, oppressione e violenza. Una minaccia che i cani da guardia del DedSec sono determinati a contrastare con ogni mezzo possibile, anche a costo di lasciarci la pelle.
 Un sacrificio che l'ex 007 Dalton Wolfe, uno degli uomini di punta della sezione londinese del collettivo, Ã¨ disposto ad accettare di buon grado, specialmente se la contropartita Ã¨ l'annientamento dell'ennesima organizzazione intenzionata a sfruttare il terrore come "arma di distrazione di massa", con l'obiettivo di favorire l'ascesa al potere di fazioni tutt'altro che benevole. La tana del Bianconiglio Ã¨ perÃ² piÃ¹ profonda del previsto, e il super agente si ritrova a fronteggiare un nemico tanto astuto quanto crudele, che nel giro di una notte devasta Londra con una serie di attacchi dinamitardi, distrugge il DedSec e lo trasforma nel capro espiatorio di una tragedia su scala nazionale. 
A mesi dal disastro, la cittÃ  Ã¨ ora nelle mani dell'esercito privato di Nigel Cass, che assieme al cartello criminale del Clan Kelley imperversa sulle strade con il placido benestare del governo, al contempo complice e vittima delle oscure macchinazioni del vero autore degli attentati: si fanno chiamare "Zero-Day", e come gli uomini del DedSec sono pronti a tutto per raggiungere il proprio scopo. La natura di questo complotto, cosÃ¬ come l'identitÃ  dei suoi autori, rappresenta il nodo centrale di una trama dai toni ben piÃ¹ cupi rispetto a quelli del precedente Watch Dogs 2 (recuperate la recensione di Watch Dogs 2), che non teme di tirare in ballo temi scottanti come il traffico di esseri umani, la manipolazione delle informazioni, il populismo mediatico e perfino le prospettive piÃ¹ spaventose del transumanesimo. Al netto di qualche fluttuazione nella qualitÃ  della scrittura, a tratti tanto sboccata da risultare macchiettistica, possiamo confermarvi che la campagna principale di Legion funziona a dovere, e si dimostra capace di mantenere alto l'interesse del giocatore con una lunga serie di svolte narrative intriganti, che aprono le porte a un paio di colpi di scena ben congegnati. Si nota qualche occasionale ridondanza, momenti in cui la sceneggiatura si fa piÃ¹ erratica e disorganica (come nel caso di un particolare "bivio morale", l'unico del gioco, senza reali conseguenze), ma nel complesso abbiamo sicuramente apprezzato la direzione scelta dal team di Ubisoft. 
Una considerazione che tiene conto di uno dei principali fattori di rischio per la narrativa di Legion, legato a doppio filo alla filosofia "play as anyone" alla base del progetto. Se la mancanza di un singolo protagonista puÃ² effettivamente ridurre il coinvolgimento nelle vicende narrate, il buon lavoro svolto dallo studio sul fronte della caratterizzazione (ludica, estetica e dialogica) dei vari avatar contribuisce ad alleviare l'impatto di questa scelta creativa. Il sapiente utilizzo di personaggi "fatti a mano" come l'onnipresente Bagley, la loquace IA al servizio del DedSec, aiuta inoltre a controbilanciare - nei limiti del possibile - gli effetti collaterali del concept di Legion, rafforzando l'efficacia di alcuni dei momenti clou del racconto. Se assecondato appieno, cercando di non cedere alla tentazione di creare una squadra di superuomini, l'elemento aleatorio del titolo puÃ² anche dare vita a meravigliosi siparietti di narrativa emergente. 
Immaginate di affrontare una delicata missione nei panni di uno dei vostri uomini di punta: un ex sicario dei Kelley armato di tutto punto e capace di schierare in campo un drone ragno personalizzato. Nel mezzo di un assalto stealth praticamente impeccabile, vi trovate alle spalle dell'avversario piÃ¹ importante, l'unico in grado di dare l'allarme e chiamare i rinforzi. Ed ecco che, con un tempismo impeccabile, assistete alla manifestazione dell'unico punto debole del soldato Ethan "Venticello" Connors: il tratto "flatulenza" attiva improvvisamente uno sfogo gassoso che, nel giro di un istante, trasforma un'operazione da manuale in un memorabile disastro. Va da sÃ© che non tutti i personaggi reclutabili hanno malus di questo genere, e non Ã¨ raro imbattersi in specialisti senza particolari difetti, eppure parliamo di note di colore capaci di arricchire l'esperienza con sfumature sorprendenti, a riprova del valore dell'idea alla base del gameplay.
Dopo aver completato la missione introduttiva con il compianto Dalton Wolfe, sarete chiamati a riaccendere le fiamme della rivolta arruolando il primo membro del nuovo DedSec londinese: la lista a vostra disposizione comprende un discreto assortimento di hacker alle prime armi (generati casualmente con criteri tesi a non inficiarne la coerenza), ognuno dotato di un paio di abilitÃ  pensate per moltiplicare le strategie d'approccio durante le missioni. 
Gli amanti dello stealth potrebbero quindi decidere di arruolare un personaggio particolarmente furtivo, mentre gli estimatori della tattica "spara e dimentica" scegliere un ex poliziotto dal grilletto facile, o alternativamente un beone da bar capace di assorbire una quantitÃ  maggiorata di danni col giusto incentivo alcolico. Le strade di Londra ospitano una quantitÃ  astronomica di possibili reclute, provviste di una gamma decisamente ampia di specialitÃ  e tratti distintivi (fino a quattro per ciascuno), tutti pensati per aggiungere qualcosa al gameplay. Prima ancora di verificare con mano la validitÃ  del disegno ludico di Ubisoft, vi capiterÃ  quindi di spendere un bel po' di tempo a curiosare (premendo il dorsale sinistro) nei profili personali di decine e decine di passanti, alla ricerca di un nuovo tassello da inserire nel vostro "dream team". Una routine resa ancor piÃ¹ gustosa dalle note a margine presenti nei diversi profili, pensate per fornire un abbozzo di backstory a ognuno dei cittadini della capitale inglese. 
Sebbene possa capitare - anche con una certa frequenza - di imbattersi in operativi praticamente sovrapponibili, o con fattezze identiche, il sistema messo a punto da Ubisoft rende il mondo di gioco piÃ¹ vivo e interessante, pur non alterando in maniera netta le dinamiche di un open world "parco giochi" sÃ¬ denso ma piuttosto classico nella struttura. 
La semplice consapevolezza che ogni pedone investito durante una fuga precipitosa potrebbe privarci di un pezzo pregiato per il nostro team, o renderne piÃ¹ difficile l'arruolamento in virtÃ¹ dei legami tra i vari personaggi, ci porta ad osservare il mondo di Legion con un'attenzione del tutto particolare, in maniera quasi istintiva. In questo senso, non possiamo astenerci dal riconoscere i meriti della rotta creativa seguita dallo studio francese, che specialmente all'inizio riesce ad arricchire efficacemente il canone ludico di Watch Dogs con una varietÃ  inedita. Sebbene le missioni, sia principali che secondarie, non alterino piÃ¹ di tanto la formula classica della serie, fatta di incursioni (piÃ¹ o meno) silenziose, hacking d'assalto, sparatorie e puzzle ambientali (i classici circuiti da ricablare), le peculiaritÃ  dei singoli personaggi spingono a sperimentare diverse soluzioni ludiche. 
Interpretando un programmatore esperto, magari uno sviluppatore di videogiochi, potremo quindi scegliere di utilizzare le nostre abilitÃ  per sfruttare la tecnologia dei nemici contro di loro, manipolando torrette e droni senza neanche avvicinarci alle "zone calde", il tutto dopo aver mandato in avanscoperta il nostro fido ragno robotico. Un approccio tattico che la scelta di un impavido hooligan potrebbe portarci a scartare in toto, in favore di una scazzottata vecchio stile in compagnia dei nostri compagni di curva, un manipolo di teste calde da evocare alla bisogna. Non mancano poi archetipi alquanto atipici, come un apicoltore in grado di indirizzare sugli avversari uno sciame di feroci insetti robot, da far esplodere all'occorrenza con un'arma non letale unica, mentre schierando in campo l'ex membro di una fazione ostile potremo accedere ai suoi avamposti senza sparare un colpo, a patto di non attirare troppo l'attenzione. 
Un arcobaleno di possibilitÃ  supportato da un level design di ottima fattura, modellato per ampliare ulteriormente l'elenco delle possibili strategie operative, sfruttando ad esempio un drone da costruzione per raggiungere agilmente il tetto di un palazzo senza allertare le guardie. In alcuni casi, la composizione delle diverse strutture apre la strada a vere e proprie sezioni platform, che richiedono di utilizzare il succitato ragno robot per superare percorsi a ostacoli piacevolmente articolati. Una delle missioni di "conquista", sbloccabili completando un terzetto obiettivi secondari in ogni quartiere, ci porterÃ  ad esempio a scalare il Big Ben dall'interno, attraversando un dedalo di ingranaggi e piattaforme sospese. Vale la pena di precisare che questi incarichi, a differenza di quanto succede in gran parte dei titoli open world di Ubisoft, offrono un buon ventaglio di sfide differenti, che culminano nell'assegnazione di un nuovo agente particolarmente capace. 
Per quanto l'assetto ludico del nuovo Watch Dogs segni una svolta positiva per la saga, dopo il primo terzo dell'avventura si comincia ad avvertire chiaramente qualche importante scricchiolio nel design della produzione. Oltre questa soglia, infatti, inizierete a notare una crescente monotonia nella struttura delle missioni, complice il frequente riutilizzo delle medesime location per incarichi principali e secondari, a volte con obiettivi sostanzialmente identici. Una consuetudine che non arriva mai a compromettere il divertimento, pur smorzando notevolmente l'entusiasmo delle prime ore. 
Un discorso che riguarda anche le missioni di arruolamento necessarie per convincere i cittadini di Londra ad unirsi al DedSec, che dopo un po' tendono a riproporre ciclicamente gli stessi schemi, senza variazioni significative. Ad amplificare queste sensazioni contribuisce inoltre un sistema di progressione (condiviso tra tutti gli operativi) alquanto limitato e non perfettamente a fuoco, che puÃ² arrivare a rendere irrilevanti le caratteristiche di determinati archetipi. Un esperto di droni, in grado di spingere gli automi a tradire i propri padroni, potrebbe ad esempio finire ben presto in coda alla vostra lista dei preferiti, quando (spendendo i punti tecnologia raccolti in giro per la cittÃ  o guadagnati completando gli incarichi) la stessa capacitÃ  sarÃ  a disposizione dell'intera squadra. Parliamo di casi limite, sia chiaro, perÃ² si percepisce la mancanza di meccaniche di progressione e personalizzazione piÃ¹ profonde, legate alle specifiche caratteristiche di ciascun personaggio e progettate per valorizzare ulteriormente il mantra del "play as anyone". 
Pesano sull'efficacia complessiva della produzione anche i difetti di un comparto tecnico che non convince appieno, specialmente per quel che concerne la gestione delle animazioni. Pur non considerando la rigiditÃ  delle espressioni facciali, in parte giustificata dalla sovrabbondanza dei possibili protagonisti, le movenze dei personaggi appaiono decisamente impacciate, e questo ha delle conseguenze palpabili - seppur non drammatiche - sulla reattivitÃ  del sistema di controllo, in particolar modo per quel che riguarda le meccaniche di movimento. 
Malgrado la presenza di una mira assistita molto generosa (forse fin troppo), anche lo shooting si dimostra a tratti un po' inaffidabile, mentre il sistema di guida ci Ã¨ sembrato identico a quello del precedente capitolo, caratterizzato da uno stile arcade al contempo "scivoloso" e pesante. Un altro ritorno non esattamente gradito Ã¨ rappresentato da un modello di IA letargico nelle fasi stealth e sconsiderato durante le sparatorie, lo stesso che negli ultimi anni il publisher sembra aver utilizzato per buona parte delle sue produzioni open world. PiÃ¹ in generale, l'ultima iterazione del Disrupt Engine di Ubisoft Montreal fatica a nascondere le rughe di un motore nato una generazione e mezzo fa, soprattutto sul fronte della gestione luminosa. 
Durante il giorno, sistema di illuminazione tende ad appiattire in maniera evidente i panorami londinesi, con la complicitÃ  di un gran numero di ombre a bassa risoluzione, mentre di notte la moltiplicazione dei punti luce e dei riflessi riesce a risollevare notevolmente la qualitÃ  del colpo d'occhio. Prima del tramonto Ã¨ inoltre piÃ¹ facile notare fenomeni di pop-in e gli effetti di una gestione piuttosto conservativa del LOD, per quanto la resa complessiva dell'immagine si attesti su buoni livelli. Questo soprattutto per i meriti di una direzione artistica in grande spolvero, che ribadisce il talento degli sviluppatori di Ubisoft per la costruzione di ambientazioni tanto suggestive quanto ricche di particolari. La Londra di Legion Ã¨ un coacervo di multiculturalismo e splendore architettonico, rielaborato per accordarsi perfettamente con lo scenario pre-cyberpunk che fa da sfondo all'avventura. Viaggiare da Camden a Nine Elms significa immergersi in un caleidoscopio di scorci da cartolina, che possono far chiudere un occhio su alcuni dei difetti piÃ¹ lampanti del comparto grafico. Buona la soliditÃ  del frame rate, mentre abbiamo particolarmente apprezzato il lavoro svolto sul fronte del doppiaggio inglese (l'unico disponibile al momento della stesura del pezzo) che, al netto di qualche forzatura quasi caricaturale, contribuisce a rinvigorire la caratterizzazione dei personaggi. Promosso anche l'accompagnamento musicale, che accoglie una buona varietÃ  di brani per tutti i gusti, tra britpop, punk spinto, classici orchestrali e metal di razza.


Watch Dogs LegionVersione Analizzata PlayStation 4 ProWatch Dogs: Legion si presenta all’appuntamento con il pubblico forte di un concept brillante, con tutto il potenziale per rivoluzionare i canoni della saga. La possibilitÃ  di arruolare uno qualsiasi dei cittadini di Londra (noi siamo arrivati a 23), ciascuno con un proprio bagaglio di abilitÃ  e strumenti, infonde una ventata di freschezza nella formula open world di Ubisoft, e all’inizio contribuisce ad amplificare notevolmente la varietÃ  generale dell’esperienza. Col passare delle ore, perÃ², questo elemento perde gradualmente d’efficacia, con la complicitÃ  di un sistema di progressione non del tutto a fuoco e di una certa monotonia nel design delle missioni, che peraltro tendono a riutilizzare piÃ¹ volte le medesime location. Questo al netto di un comparto narrativo di buona fattura che tiene alto l’interesse del giocatore fino ai titoli di coda, riuscendo peraltro a compensare piuttosto bene la mancanza di un protagonista modellato ad hoc. Malgrado gli evidenti limiti di un engine nato all’alba della scorsa generazione, la direzione artistica tratteggia una cornice decisamente suggestiva per le avventure londinesi del DedSec, mentre l’ottimo doppiaggio inglese favorisce la caratterizzazione dei personaggi, seppur con qualche eccesso quasi caricaturale. In definitiva, pur essendo perfettamente in grado di offrire al pubblico un buon numero di ore di divertimento (una quindicina che possono facilmente diventare 35 completando ogni attivitÃ  offerta dal mondo di gioco), Watch Dogs Legion manca di esprimere appieno le potenzialitÃ  del suo concept di base, cedendo alle lusinghe di un modello di open world che, a fine generazione, richiede a gran voce interventi di svecchiamento piÃ¹ incisivi.

The distance vector, hybrid and link state are the 3 types of the routing protocols. In that, the distance vector routing algorithm will send the complete routing table and its information to neighbors. The RIP is the distance vector protocol type which has 2 version such as RIPv1 and RIPv2. In the below session, the configuration, verification and troubleshoot part of the RIPv2. As the new technology grows rapidly, the importance for the version 2 is higher than the version 1. In that version 1 is classful and version 2 is classless and the routing updates are multicast. 
The RIPv2 is the classless, distance vector routing protocol as defined in the RFC 1723. It means that it also includes a subnet mask with a network address in the routing updates. The RIPv2 also supports the CIDR supernets, discontiguous networks and VLSM. Due to the difficulties in the RIPv1, the RIP v2 was developed. It is equipped with the capability to support the subnet information and also supports the classless inter domain routing. The router which receives routing updates from the multiple routers advertising a same classful summary route will not find which subnets belongs to the which summary route. It is the inability which leads to the unexpected results such as misrouted packets. The next hop address is included in the updates and the authentication is an optional one in the RIPv2. However, with the RIP version 2 automatic summarization will be disabled with no auto summary command. Then the automatic summarization has to be disable to support the discontiguous networks. The RIP version 2 maintains 15 as the hop count limit and also incorporated the password authentication mechanism. Even though the passwords are transmitted in the clear text format, that is found insufficient for the secure communications on an internet. The RIPv2 is an enhancement of the RIP version 1 extensions and features instead of an entirely new protocol. In that, the enhanced features in version 2 are such as:
The similarities between the RIP version 1 and version 2 are as follows:
The administrative value for the RIP version 2 is 120 and it is used in the flat networks, small or at the edge of a larger network. It uses the UDP port 520 and supports the VLSM. The metric is the router hop count and the periodic route updates sent each 30 seconds to multicast address 224.0.0.9 and 25 routes per RIP messages and 24 if authentication is used. 
The RIPv2 is almost similar as the RIPv2, but there are some more important differences which make the RIPv2 as more scalable than the RIPv1. As it is a distance vector protocol, each router running RIP sends the complete routing tables on all the active interfaces at the periodic time intervals. Additionally, the loop avoidance scheme and timers are the same in both of the RIP version as stated above. 
The configuration of the RIP version 2 is straightforward. Given below is an example:
Lab_C(config)#router rip
Lab_C(config-router)#network 192.168.40.0
Lab_C(config-router)#network 192.168.50.0
Lab_C(config-router)#version 2
Here, all you need to perform is just add the command as version 2 under (config-router)#prompt and running RIPv2.
The redistribution command is the way to disseminate the static route from 1 router to another through the routing protocol. While comparing the RIPv1 and RIPv2 message formats, the RIPv2 message format is same as that of the RIPv1, but has 2 extensions. The first extension is a subnet mask field. In this first extension, it allows the 32 bit mask to be included in the routing information protocol route entry. Then the receiving router has no longer depends upon a subnet mask of an inbound interface or a classful mask while determining the subnet mask for the route. Then the second extension is the additional of next hop address. In that the next hop addresses are used to analyze the better next hop address, suppose only one exist, then the address of a sending router. If the field is set to all as zeros(0.0.0.0), then the address of a sending router is a better next hop address. given below is the comparison of the RIPv1 and RIPv2 message formats. 
Configuring RIPv2: 
Configuring the RIPv2 needs using the version 2 commands and the RIPv2 will ignore the RIP version 2 updates also. The RIPv2 will automatically summarize the routes at the major network boundaries and also can summarize routes with the subnet mask which is smaller than the classful subnet mask. 
After that it is essential to disable the auto summary in the RIP version 2. In that to disable the automatic summarization issue the no auto summary command is used.  While using the RIPv2 with the automatic summarization turned off, there each mask and subnet has their own certain entry along with an exit interface as well as the next hop address to reach that subnet. In this step, to verify the information is sent or not from RIP version 2 will use the command of "debug ip rip". 
?	To verify RIPv2 is configuration, use the below command
-	show ip     protocols ---- 
When the network uses the VLSM IP addressing scheme. Use the classless routing protocol (RIPv2) to disseminate the network addresses and its subnet mask. When it comes to CIDR, it will use supernetting. The supernetting is the bunch of a contiguous class network, which is addressed as the single network. 
In this, to verify that the supernets are sent and received or not use commands like "show ip route" or " debug ip route". 
Verifying and troubleshooting:
The configuring the routing protocol is not much difficult, but to troubleshoot issue will be very challenging to the less experienced designer. Anyhow, the competent designer with more practical knowledge can able to foresee and also prevent the occurrence of the future troubles. 
Detect the issue by starting from basics. It is important to verify whether the cables are connected properly or not. It is the major issue that the designer fails to perform before taking any step to troubleshoot the issue. Check whether all the interfaces are up as well running well in good condition. Then check the IP addresses that are configured correctly with a right subnetwork. As it is the RIP version 2, check whether the version 2 is enabled or not. Then verify the routing addresses which are implemented correctly or not. To determine routing table in  detail, disable the automatic summarization. Check the status of the links connected to the protocol and IP address. Remove all the unneeded configuration commands which are not required to perform this RIPv2 configuration and check the subnet mask configuration. There are several ways to verify and troubleshoot the RIPv2. 
 There are many commands used in the RIP version configuration and verification as shown in the below diagram. 
The commands used to verify the operation of the RIP version 2 is as follows:
This command will assist to determine the network of the IP address which is currently as either remotely or directly connected. While this command shows all the routing table, you can use it to find which Routing information protocol route is in the routing table with the help of show ip route command. 
It is the first command which is used to check for the network convergence. Like examining the routing table, it is essential to look for the routes which you expect to be present in the routing table and those should not be in a routing table. 
This command helps to display the current state and parameters of the active routing protocol process. It also allows to verify the automatic summarization status. It also verifies several critical items such as verify the RIP is enabled or not, checks the version of the routing information protocol, the automatic summarization status as well as the networks which were included in a network statement. Then the routing information source listed at a bottom of output are an RIP neighbors from which that router is receiving updates currently. 
It helps to display the information on a routing information protocol transaction, use this command in privileged EXEC mode. To disable the debugging output, use no form of this command. It helps to see what is going deep within the RIP. It also verifies the information on the router which exchanging now for updates. 
This excellent command used to examine the routing update contents that are sent and received by the router. There will be many times when the route is being received by the router but it is  not being added to a routing table. The static route can also be configured for a same network, which is being advertised. By default, the static route has the lower administrative distance than any of the dynamic routing protocols, and it will take the precedence in being added to a routing table. 
It verifies which interfaces are configured with the IP address and also whether it is in down or up state. 
It is a much useful tool to verify the end to end connection in between the networks. It is an easy way to check the round trip connectivity. If the connection is not successful, start by pinging a local interface. If it is successful, then ping a router interface which directly connected to the network. Suppose that process is successful, then continue pinging interface on every successive router. If the ping is unsuccessful, then examine both the routers and entire routers between them to determine why and where the ping is failing. 
It is one among the useful command helps to verify the running IP interface or other configuration that is in its entry. This command will be used to check the entire commands which is configured recently. Normally, other commands are very efficient and offer more information than the simple current configuration listing. Although, this command is useful in finding if anything obvious was misconfigured or forgotten. 
When troubleshooting the Routing information protocol examine the version. It is important that to configure the RIPv2, you need to use only RIPv2. Check the network statements which are correctly typed or anything missing in the statements. If the summarized routes are not at all needed, then disable the automatic summarization. It is really good to authenticate the routing information. Because it prevents the possibility of getting invalid routing updates as well as the contents of the routing updates are encrypted. The EIGRP, IS-IS, BGP, OSPF and RIPv2 are the types of routing protocols which can be used for the  authentication process. 
When it comes to the internal routing protocols, the routing information protocol version 2 plays an important and common routing protocol which is used widely. This RIPv2 is the most important one that every network administrator and designer has to know to perform the tasks in their routine activity. It is one of the easiest protocols to configure, but needs dedication and deep knowledge to verify and troubleshoot the RIPv2. The above session will get you understand the configuration of the routing information protocol version 2 and why it is more important than the earlier version 1. In addition to that, you can learn how to verify and troubleshoot the RIP version 2.  The RIPv2 is the valuable tool which gives a simple and quick IP routing and it must be in each network administrator toolbox also. It overtakes most of the limitations that seems in the version 1 and version 2 has more features than before.

After directing Pierce Brosnanâs first James Bond movie GoldenEye so successfully, Martin Campbell was invited to return to the franchise for the next reboot, Casino Royale.
This was the last time EON Productions held their secret auditions for a new 007, some 18 years ago, where he and producers screen tested around eight potential new Bonds including Daniel Craig and Henry Cavill.
Famously, the future Superman star just lost out to the latest 007 actor and now the director has shared little-known details from the casting process which included acting out a scene in a towel from Sean Connery's From Russia with Love.
Speaking exclusively with Express.co.uk to promote this week's London Action Festival, Campbell was very positive about the then 22-year-oldâs audition.

Campbell, who had pointed out to Cavill that he was a little chubby for 007 during the process, told us nevertheless: âHe looked great in the audition. His acting was tremendous. And look, if Daniel didnât exist Henry would have made an excellent Bond. He looked terrific, he was in great physical shapeâ¦ very handsome, very chiselled. He just looked a little young at that time back then.â
Asked if even at 40 the Superman star could still play Bond he said: âBy the time Daniel got to [No Time To Die] really he was at an age where one more would have been too old for him. I think they sign on for three Bonds, Iâm not absolutely 100 per cent certain of that. I know with Pierce he had to sign on to three when we did him. So thatâs going to take, what, six years of your life maybe? I suspect Daniel [had] the same deal. And the next guyâs going to have to do that.
âHenryâs 40, so by the time heâs done the third one heâs going to be 50 and anything beyond thatâs two, three years per Bond. Heâs in good shape Henry, heâs a good guy. He did very well in the audition, but ironically he was too young.â
The director, who would be open to rebooting Bond a third time, also dispelled the rumour that he favoured Cavill â who is currently at 7-2 to be the next 007 â over Craig.

Campbell said: âI wasnât favouring Henry. The way they work with Bond and itâs pretty terrific is when they decide on the actor and you audition â in our case, it was eight people â itâs very democratic. You sit around a table, eight or nine of you.
âIt was myself and the producers, casting director etc etc. And you go through the eight people and you put your hand up as you talk through each person and ultimately everybody has to be unanimous in their decision, if you see what I mean.â
This week, the two-time Bond director is taking part in the London Action Festival where heâll speak at a Q&A during a 25th-anniversary screening of The Mask of Zorro. The 79-year-old will also be on a panel called Anatomy Of A Set Piece, in which he will talk about what he thinks is one of the best action scenes in cinema history.
Asked what his favourite from his own movies are, he said: âThat opening of Casino was pretty good. I was quite pleased with that. And the end scene of that too.â
THE LONDON ACTION FESTIVAL runs from Wednesday 21st â Sunday 25th June. Tickets are on sale now via the website HERE

Community sites and accounts which are unable to meet this standard of conduct will be required to cease use of the Fedora trademarks, and will be not be promoted/advertised by Fedora. Our intent is for all Fedora community members to have a positive and welcoming experience in all community spaces, official and unofficial.

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks on community sites and accounts to show your support for the Fedora Project, provided that:

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks on business cards identifying the community member as a Fedora Ambassador.  The guidelines relating to such usage are set forth in this section.

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission on business cards to identify one's affiliation with the Fedora Project, provided the Fedora Ambassador Business card template located  at this URL is used.  This is the only business card use permitted; community members may not use any Fedora Trademarks or refer to the Fedora Project on any work-related business cards. Use of business contact information on the template is also frowned upon. 

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks to promote free and open source software events such as a Linux installfest or community free software trade show.  The guidelines relating to such usage are set forth in this section.

It is permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks without prior permission to promote free and open source software events where individuals in the Fedora Project appear as Fedora Ambassadors, distribute Fedora Media, or otherwise represent the Fedora Project, provided the general guidelines above are followed. If you would like to make some non-software goods to give away at the event and don't already have a license to do so, see  Non-software goods.

It is permissible to use the Fedora trademarks in the title and content of a publication, provided that:

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to show support for Fedora by placing the Fedora Trademarks in a theme, persona, or skin intended to alter the appearance of an application.  The guidelines relating to such usage are set forth in this section.

For any other use of the Fedora Trademarks in a domain name, please read the Local community domains page and contact the Council.

In the past, community members have inquired whether it is permissible to use Fedora Trademarks on non-software goods such as T-shirts, stickers, and pens.

Community members may request from the Fedora Council a license to use the Fedora trademarks on non-software related goods, services, or other entities.  The Council, or someone it delegates for the task, will ask to see the proposed designs before approving the use.

The following uses of the Fedora Trademarks or Secondary Mark are not approved under any foreseeable circumstances.

Except as set forth herein, the trademark owner retains and reserves all rights to the Fedora Trademarks and their use, including the right to modify these guidelines.

These guidelines may be amended from time to time at the discretion of the Council.

One of the purposes of the FedoraÂ® Project is to make a cutting-edge version of LinuxÂ® widely available in consistent format that the public can come to trust.  To achieve this purpose it is important that the technology can quickly be identified and that the recipient knows the technology they are receiving is the official and unmodified version.  Red Hat has chosen the FedoraÂ® mark to identify this effort and is granting usage rights in the Fedora Trademarks as previously described in this document in order to assure widespread availability.

For more information about the requirements for logo size, appearance, placement, and other considerations, refer to  the Logo/Usage Guidelines for the Fedora mark and the   Secondary Trademark Usage Guidelines for the Secondary Mark.

Bloomberg is reporting that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to fast-track tech legislation that focuses on children, including the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), an extremely controversial bill that has been opposed by human rights experts and nearly every major LGBTQ organization in the US. Digital rights group Fight for the Future issued the following statement, which can be attributed to the group’s director, Evan Greer (she/her):
“This is outrageous. Leader Schumer was more or less single-handedly responsible for derailing the most serious efforts at tech reform last Congress, and now he wants to revive deeply controversial legislation that would put vulnerable kids in danger and pour gasoline on the growing attacks that LGBTQ+ young people are facing across the US. 
KOSA is fatally flawed and a flurry of last-minute changes during the last Congress failed to address the concerns of LGBTQ groups and experts. There is no safe way to create a vague duty of care that encompasses content moderation and user speech at a time when right wing politicians are actively conflating queerness with criminality and predation, and state attorneys general are investigating supportive families of transgender youth for “child abuse” simply for seeking medically recommended care for their kids. Nearly 250 anti-LGBTQ state laws have already been introduced this year. Legislation like KOSA would give the law enforcement agencies of those same states new tools to target and oppress LGBTQ+ youth and adults. 
It’s disgusting that Senate Democrats would even consider reviving legislation that would hurt the LGBTQ community while they claim to be defending us. They should immediately drop this bill and instead advance thoughtful and comprehensive measures that strike at the root of Big Tech giants harm. We need policies that lead to the type of world we want our kids to grow up in. That means ending surveillance capitalism and cracking down on harmful business practices by advancing thoughtful regulation, rather than taking the easy path of advancing bills that claim to “think of the children” while throwing them under the bus.”

Weâre so lucky to have friends like the good people at Proton, a privacy-focused company that builds tools, like a VPN and an encrypted email service, that many of us on the team use ourselves.
In December, Proton organized a raffle for one of 10 Lifetime accounts to benefit groups working on digital and human rights issues, including us! Weâre so excited to announce we received $109,854 from this effort, a combination of raffle earnings and Protonâs own contribution.
As a small organization with a modest budget, Protonâs fundraising is huge for us. Itâll fuel our 2023 campaigns and enable us to get really creative with our out-of-the-box organizingâno airplane banner too high. Here are some of our top priorities for the coming year:

OSPF-2 Protocol Overview
OSPF-2 Protocol Overview


Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a recent entry into the Internet
interior routing scene.  OSPF Version 2 is documented in
RFC 1583 (a lengthy document
that I find very difficult to read).
Sanctioned by the IETF, it is intended
to become Internet's preferred interior routing protocol.  OSPF is a
link-state routing protocol
with a complex set of options and features. 
Not all of these features are available on all implementations,
but some of its advantages are:


Scalability.  OSPF is specifically designed to operate with
     larger networks.  It does not impose a hop-count restriction
     and permits its domain to be subdivided for easier
     management.

Full subnetting support.  OSPF can fully support subnetting,
     including VLSM and non-contiguous subnets.

Hello packets.  OSPF uses small "hello" packets to verify
     link operation without transferring large tables.  In stable
     networks, large updates occur only once every 30 minutes.

TOS routing.  OSPF can route packets by different criterion
     based on their Type Of Service (TOS) field.  For example,
     file transfers could be routed over a satellite link while
     terminal I/O could avoid such high delays.  This requires
     cooperative applications on the end systems.

Tagged routes.  Routes can be tagged with arbitrary values,
     easing interoperation with EGPs, which can tag OSPF routes
     with AS numbers.


OSPF has some disadvantages as well.  Chief among them are its
complexity and its demands on memory and computation.  Although
link-state protocols are not difficult to understand, OSPF muddles
the picture with plenty of options and features.

OSPF divides its routing domain into areas.  Area 0, the
backbone, is required.  This divides interior routing into two
levels.  If traffic must travel between two areas, the packets
are first routed to the backbone.  This may cause non-optimal
routes, since interarea routing is not done until the packet
reaches the backbone.  Once there, it is routed to the destination
area, which is then responsible for final delivery.  This
layering permits addresses to be consolidated by area, reducing
the size of the link state databases.
Small networks can operate with a single OSPF area, which must be area 0.

OSPF divides networks into several classes, including
point-to-point, multiaccess, and
non-broadcast multiaccess.  A serial link connecting
two routers together would be a point-to-point link, while
an Ethernet or Token Ring segment would be a multiaccess link.
A Frame Relay or X.25 cloud would be classified as
non-broadcast multiaccess.

Multiaccess networks (like Ethernet)
use a designated router (DR) to avoid
the problem of each router forming a link with every other
router on a Ethernet, resulting in a N^2 explosion
in the number of links.  Instead, the DR manages all the
link state advertisements for the Ethernet.  Selecting
the DR requires an election process, during which a
Backup Designated Router (BDR) is also selected.  OSPF
provides a priority feature to help the network
engineer influence the choice of DR and BDR, but in
practice this is difficult.  Link layer multicasting
is also used, if available, to avoid broadcasts and
better target routing updates.

Non-broadcast multiaccess networks (like X.25) also
use the designated router concept, but since broadcasts
(and presumably multicasts) are not supported, the
identity of neighboring routers must be specified
manually.  A DR on such a network without a complete
list of neighbors will cause a loss of connectivity,
even though the network is otherwise functional.
If possible, I recommend configuring such networks
as a collection of point-to-point links, simply
to avoid the intricacies of DR election.

OSPF's primary means of verifying continuing operation
of the network is via its Hello Protocol.  Every OSPF
speaker sends small hello packets out each of its
interfaces every ten seconds.  It is through receipt of
these packets that OSPF neighbors initially learn of
each other's existance.  Hello packets are not forwarded
or recorded in the OSPF database, but if none are
recieved from a particular neighbor for forty seconds,
that neighbor is marked down.  LSAs are then generated
marking links through a down router as down.
The hello timer values can be configured, though they
must be consistant across all routers on a network segment.

Link state advertisements also age.  The originating
router readvertises an LSA after it has remained unchanged for
thirty minutes.  If an LSA ages to more than an hour, it
is flushed from the databases.  These timer values are
called architectural constants by the RFC.

OSPFs various timers interact as follows:


If a link goes down for twenty seconds, then comes back up,
OSPF doesn't notice.

If a link flaps constantly, but at least one of every four
Hello packets make it across, OSPF doesn't notice.

If a link goes down for anywhere from a minute to half an hour,
OSPF floods an LSA when it goes down, and another LSA when it comes
back up.

If a link stays down for more than half an hour, LSAs originated
by remote routers (that have become unreachable) begin to age out.
When the link comes back up, all these LSAs will be reflooded.

If a link is down for more than an hour, any LSAs originated
by remote routers will have aged out and been flushed.  When the
link comes back up, it will be as if it were brand new.

OSPF-2 Protocol Overview



Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a recent entry into the Internet
interior routing scene.  OSPF Version 2 is documented in
RFC 1583 (a lengthy document
that I find very difficult to read).
Sanctioned by the IETF, it is intended
to become Internet's preferred interior routing protocol.  OSPF is a
link-state routing protocol
with a complex set of options and features. 
Not all of these features are available on all implementations,
but some of its advantages are:


Scalability.  OSPF is specifically designed to operate with
     larger networks.  It does not impose a hop-count restriction
     and permits its domain to be subdivided for easier
     management.

Full subnetting support.  OSPF can fully support subnetting,
     including VLSM and non-contiguous subnets.

Hello packets.  OSPF uses small "hello" packets to verify
     link operation without transferring large tables.  In stable
     networks, large updates occur only once every 30 minutes.

TOS routing.  OSPF can route packets by different criterion
     based on their Type Of Service (TOS) field.  For example,
     file transfers could be routed over a satellite link while
     terminal I/O could avoid such high delays.  This requires
     cooperative applications on the end systems.

Tagged routes.  Routes can be tagged with arbitrary values,
     easing interoperation with EGPs, which can tag OSPF routes
     with AS numbers.


OSPF has some disadvantages as well.  Chief among them are its
complexity and its demands on memory and computation.  Although
link-state protocols are not difficult to understand, OSPF muddles
the picture with plenty of options and features.

OSPF divides its routing domain into areas.  Area 0, the
backbone, is required.  This divides interior routing into two
levels.  If traffic must travel between two areas, the packets
are first routed to the backbone.  This may cause non-optimal
routes, since interarea routing is not done until the packet
reaches the backbone.  Once there, it is routed to the destination
area, which is then responsible for final delivery.  This
layering permits addresses to be consolidated by area, reducing
the size of the link state databases.
Small networks can operate with a single OSPF area, which must be area 0.

OSPF divides networks into several classes, including
point-to-point, multiaccess, and
non-broadcast multiaccess.  A serial link connecting
two routers together would be a point-to-point link, while
an Ethernet or Token Ring segment would be a multiaccess link.
A Frame Relay or X.25 cloud would be classified as
non-broadcast multiaccess.

Multiaccess networks (like Ethernet)
use a designated router (DR) to avoid
the problem of each router forming a link with every other
router on a Ethernet, resulting in a N^2 explosion
in the number of links.  Instead, the DR manages all the
link state advertisements for the Ethernet.  Selecting
the DR requires an election process, during which a
Backup Designated Router (BDR) is also selected.  OSPF
provides a priority feature to help the network
engineer influence the choice of DR and BDR, but in
practice this is difficult.  Link layer multicasting
is also used, if available, to avoid broadcasts and
better target routing updates.

Non-broadcast multiaccess networks (like X.25) also
use the designated router concept, but since broadcasts
(and presumably multicasts) are not supported, the
identity of neighboring routers must be specified
manually.  A DR on such a network without a complete
list of neighbors will cause a loss of connectivity,
even though the network is otherwise functional.
If possible, I recommend configuring such networks
as a collection of point-to-point links, simply
to avoid the intricacies of DR election.

OSPF's primary means of verifying continuing operation
of the network is via its Hello Protocol.  Every OSPF
speaker sends small hello packets out each of its
interfaces every ten seconds.  It is through receipt of
these packets that OSPF neighbors initially learn of
each other's existance.  Hello packets are not forwarded
or recorded in the OSPF database, but if none are
recieved from a particular neighbor for forty seconds,
that neighbor is marked down.  LSAs are then generated
marking links through a down router as down.
The hello timer values can be configured, though they
must be consistant across all routers on a network segment.

Link state advertisements also age.  The originating
router readvertises an LSA after it has remained unchanged for
thirty minutes.  If an LSA ages to more than an hour, it
is flushed from the databases.  These timer values are
called architectural constants by the RFC.

OSPFs various timers interact as follows:


If a link goes down for twenty seconds, then comes back up,
OSPF doesn't notice.

If a link flaps constantly, but at least one of every four
Hello packets make it across, OSPF doesn't notice.

If a link goes down for anywhere from a minute to half an hour,
OSPF floods an LSA when it goes down, and another LSA when it comes
back up.

If a link stays down for more than half an hour, LSAs originated
by remote routers (that have become unreachable) begin to age out.
When the link comes back up, all these LSAs will be reflooded.

If a link is down for more than an hour, any LSAs originated
by remote routers will have aged out and been flushed.  When the
link comes back up, it will be as if it were brand new.

OSPF's primary means of verifying continuing operation
of the network is via its Hello Protocol.  Every OSPF
speaker sends small hello packets out each of its
interfaces every ten seconds.  It is through receipt of
these packets that OSPF neighbors initially learn of
each other's existance.  Hello packets are not forwarded
or recorded in the OSPF database, but if none are
recieved from a particular neighbor for forty seconds,
that neighbor is marked down.  LSAs are then generated
marking links through a down router as down.
The hello timer values can be configured, though they
must be consistant across all routers on a network segment.

Link state advertisements also age.  The originating
router readvertises an LSA after it has remained unchanged for
thirty minutes.  If an LSA ages to more than an hour, it
is flushed from the databases.  These timer values are
called architectural constants by the RFC.

OSPFs various timers interact as follows:


If a link goes down for twenty seconds, then comes back up,
OSPF doesn't notice.

If a link flaps constantly, but at least one of every four
Hello packets make it across, OSPF doesn't notice.

If a link goes down for anywhere from a minute to half an hour,
OSPF floods an LSA when it goes down, and another LSA when it comes
back up.

If a link stays down for more than half an hour, LSAs originated
by remote routers (that have become unreachable) begin to age out.
When the link comes back up, all these LSAs will be reflooded.

If a link is down for more than an hour, any LSAs originated
by remote routers will have aged out and been flushed.  When the
link comes back up, it will be as if it were brand new.

Skip to license text
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 <https://fsf.org/>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest

free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary.

Posted By Shubhankar Parijat | On 28th, Oct. 2020
In Watch Dogs: Legion, DedSec is the protagonist. There is no single character to pull you through the story from beginning to end, no lone central figure with personal stakes and drama, no leading man or lady to take the spotlight. Instead, DedSec and the resistance it builds up to free London from an oppressive regime takes centerstage, and thanks to its ambitious gameplay systems, Watch Dogs: Legion successfully manages to pull you into a city that feels like itâs actually growing more defiant, reclaiming its freedom bit by bit, and coming together to fight against a common enemy.
You can play as anyone- thatâs been Ubisoftâs central pitch for Watch Dogs: Legion since the day they announced the game, and itâs gotten quite a lot of attention, understandably so. After a short prologue that ends with a large-scale terrorist attack on London by an unknown party calling itself Zero Day, DedSec is blamed for the attack and hunted down, while private military company Albion takes over the city and its administration- which quickly leads to an oppressive, dystopian surveillance state taken straight out of George Orwellâs worst nightmare.

"Rather than feeling like different skins that have some minor stat variations here and there, the characters in Legion fall into a vast array of archetypes that differ from each other in significant ways, paving the way for unique strengths and weaknesses that are immediately apparent."
Now, itâs up to DedSec to rise back up, clear their name, and free London from the clutches of tyranny- and you play as literally every single person DedSec recruits, which can be literally any character you can see in the entire game and its open world. The idea is ambitious enough that itâs more or less guaranteed to turn heads- but does the execution do justice to the concept? Is it something that meaningfully changes the way you play the game, or is it ultimately just a gimmick? Does it have enough going on to keep players engaged throughout the course of a long open world adventure, or does the novelty wear thing after a while?
Thankfully, the play as anyone mechanic is far from a gimmick. Watch Dogs: Legion loses something in the storytelling department without a central personality to latch on to, but then story has never really been the point of Watch Dogs. The point of Watch Dogs is its blend of hacking gameplay, stealth, and open world mayhem, and how it combines those elements to create a systemic experience where the players actually have some choice in how they want to play. And these are exactly the areas that benefit the most from Legionâs play as anyone mechanic.
The game gets the most crucial thing right- the characters that you recruit and switch back and forth between throughout the experience feel meaningfully different from each other. Rather than feeling like different skins that have some minor stat variations here and there, the characters in Legion fall into a vast array of archetypes that differ from each other in significant ways, paving the way for unique strengths and weaknesses that are immediately apparent. A construction worker might not necessarily have the best weapons or be the most agile, but they can grant you access to construction sites that are restricted for everyone else, and also have a drone that you can hop on top of and basically use to fly across the entire map. On the flipside, the bare knuckle brawler I have in my roster wouldnât be my first choice for a mission that requires stealth and finesse, but when I know Iâm about to get into a fight, heâs the guy I want.
Situations such as these keep emerging organically in Watch Dogs: Legion, where characters prove their usefulness in several different ways. The spy in my roster has a car that can become invisible and fire rockets, as well as a spy watch that fires off an EMP pulse. The beekeeper uses nanotech bees to swarm enemies and is resistant to shock attacks. The professional hitman is incredibly agile and effective in combat, both with guns and in hand-to-hand. The reception worker at one of the hotels in the city isnât exactly anything special, but when I recruited him, I was able to get into the restricted areas in that hotel with no fuss. The Albion officer allows me to access several high-security sections and buildings in the city, as long as I maintain some distance from others in the uniform who might see through my disguise.

"Legion adds another impressive layer of depth to this whole web by giving each character their own backstory, their own traits and relationships, their own schedules and motivations."
And thatâs just scratching the surface of the sheer breadth of options available- from journalists and doctors to architects and bloggers, from taxi drivers and members of organized crime groups to smugglers and hackers, thereâs a ridiculous number of different kinds of people you can recruit to your cause and play as in Watch Dogs: Legion, each bringing something different to the table. Characters often move and behave differently as well- some heave steadier aim, some attack with fast flurries of punches in melee combat, some can perform dodge rolls, some are better drivers. And just like in real life, not all of them are winners.
Legion adds another impressive layer of depth to this whole web by giving each character their own backstory, their own traits and relationships, their own schedules and motivations. Using the Deep Profiler, you can use this information to your advantage as you try to recruit them to your cause. A character that might not be too willing to join DedSecâs cause because of a personal dislike for the group might become more willing to hear you out if you help them in other ways, some that might not even be presented in the game as obvious choices.
For instance, the Deep Profiler might tell you the location of an adversary of someone you might be trying to recruit, at which point you can choose to head to that location and, say, hack that adversaryâs email account and leak sensitive data. The person you were trying to recruit will become more willing to join your cause, while any friends that they have will become supportive of DedSec after hearing about how you helped them as well. At the same time though, the person whose data you leaked will now have a grudge against DedSec, as will any associates or connections they have.
What this means is that your actions in Watch Dogs: Legion are constantly having these ripple effects that keep on spreading outward, making it seem like the city is dynamically responding to your actions and changing as you play more. People you may never have met may have already been affected by your actions- that person you thoughtlessly ran over while driving about the open world in your sports car might just have been the sister of a high-ranking police officer that may have been useful to your cause, but now hates DedSec.

"âPlay as anyoneâ is a catchy term for the mechanic, sure, but it also oversimplifies just how vast and complex it really is."
Itâs emergent gameplay at its finest, a perfect example of a game allowing players to create and weave their own stories through a web of gameplay systems. âPlay as anyoneâ is a catchy term for the mechanic, sure, but it also oversimplifies just how vast and complex it really is. Yes, you can play is anyone- but thereâs also so much more thatâs constantly going on behind the scenes. It makes the game and its world feel alive and extremely responsive to the player, making for far more immersion than I had anticipated.
Something that is much more formulaic but still worthy of praise is the game-wide objective of freeing London from its oppressive rulers, taking on side objectives to disrupt propaganda and spread awareness and liberating the entire city, one borough at a time. Each time you complete the side activities in a single borough, you unlock a final set-piece mission, and once you complete that, you liberate that borough, which unlocks various rewards, such as special recruits.
Itâs not exactly the most inventive structure for an open world game, especially a Ubisoft open world game â hell, Assassinâs Creed Syndicate did pretty much the exact same thing in London â but it works well and adds an engaging layer of long-form progression to the proceedings. The borough side activities are usually also a joy to tackle each time, allowing you to approach different challenges with different characters and different strategies. On top of that, the final missions for each borough are also always a ton of fun, and they offer plenty of variety, from a high-speed car chase through the streets to a platforming sequence that sees you guiding a Spiderbot up through the innards of Big Ben to a timed mission where you have to shoot a number of armoured vehicles scattered throughout a borough with a combat drone.
Meanwhile, simply messing about in the open world and trying to cause as much chaos as possible is still as mindlessly addictive as it should be in an open world game of this nature. Itâs even better in Legion, in fact, than it was in Watch Dogs 2, because thereâs so much fun to be had in discovering the different ways you can wreak havoc in the open world with different characters. Looking for tech points around the city can also be enjoyable and occasionally clever distractions every now and then, while driving controls have improved considerably over Watch Dogs 2 as well. Thereâs also a nice variety of vehicles in the game (with many that fully embrace Legionâs much more hardcore cyberpunk setting), and driving them around is always a blast, too.

"The parkour is still a bit rough around the edges, as it was in Watch Dogs 2."
The parkour is still a bit rough around the edges, as it was in Watch Dogs 2. Itâs a lot less automated in Legion, so it feels a little less wonky, but charactersâ movement still feels a bit too unresponsive and sluggish while trying to climb over walls and obstacles sometimes, and every now and then you will run into a wall that is low enough for you to climb over, but the game wonât let you. Similar issues also present themselves with the gameâs cover mechanics, which can be everything from too sticky to the very opposite. There have been plenty of times where I have been forced into tight spots during firefights because of the gameâs cover mechanics, which was frustrating. Melee combat, at least, has improved significantly, which is nice to see.
As I mentioned earlier in this review, though Watch Dogs: Legion excels at emergent storytelling thanks to its complex gameplay systems, its actual scripted story is nothing to write home about. In fact, I canât tell you the number of times I lost track of the minor nitty-gritties, why I should care about them, and what their place in the story even was. Itâs a story thatâs easy to tune out of, and the lack of any real central characters or cast to invest in or latch on to makes things worse. The whole story mostly seems like a bit of a blur to me. It helps that the game is incredibly fun outside of the story, so if nothing else, at least Watch Dogs: Legion is okay with you ignoring the main narrative completely and making your own fun.
There are some technical issues to speak of as well. Watch Dogs: Legion is a solid looking game. The neon-drenched streets of near-future cyberpunk London are stunning to look at and excellent to traverse, and the city looks even better at night, or when its raining. Some details donât quite stack up upon close inspection though â charactersâ faces in particular look quite unnatural and plasticky â while there are also some weird lip sync issues and jarring canned animations. All too often, characters also donât sound anything close to what you would think they would sound like at first glance, though given the sheer breadth and depth of the pool Ubisoft were dealing with here with literally thousands of characters, it sort of makes sense that not each and every one of them can be a perfect audio-visual match.
There are some minor distant pop-in issues, but nothing thatâs ever too noticeable (though textures on cargo drones in particular seem to take quite long to load at times, for whatever reason). Load times are long and frequent though, and Iâm definitely looking forward to playing the game on next-gen hardware to get that annoyance out of the way. Finally, there were also two instances where the game crashed completely, booting me to my consoleâs home screen and forcing me to restart.

"In stark contrast to how this series started out, Watch Dogs: Legion doesnât just make grand and ambitious promises- it actually lives up to them."
Watch Dogs: Legion is definitely the best game in the series so far- and dare I say, one of the most engaging and inventive open world games I have played in years. Its play as anyone mechanic is genius in its premise and impressive in its execution, hiding a ridiculous amount of depth that you can get lost in for dozens of hours. In stark contrast to how this series started out, Watch Dogs: Legion doesnât just make grand and ambitious promises- it actually lives up to them.
This game was reviewed on the Xbox One.
Characters feeling meaningfully different from each other with unique strengths and weaknesses; Tons of character types and archetypes to choose between; The game is incredibly reactive to the player's actions; Freeing London one borough at a time is engaging; Open world activities are still a lot of fun.
Parkour and cover mechanics are a bit sluggish; Long and frequent load times; Some technical issues here and there.

Gotta-recruit-them-all would be an accurate slogan to explain my time with the game. Sure at its core, Watch Dogs Legion is a third-person shooting/sneaking/driving game. But its ambitious play-as-anyone system and NPC simulation gently nudge it into the realm of immersive sims.
You can find a video version of this review on my YouTube Channel.
In a gaming climate of derivatives, trend chasers, and reskins, it’s nice to see a big dog like Ubisoft tackle a fresh concept like this. We should praise the attempt, regardless of its execution, especially since Ubisoft is often the butt of jokes in conversations regarding repetitive formulas.
That said, the execution is indeed solid even if it does stumble in places. There are two very large factors to consider with Watch Dogs Legion. One is your own expectations, games do indeed have limits, and Watch Dogs Legion is no different. The second is in order to get the most out of the game the player needs to actively commit, and engage with its systems.
That wasn’t a criticism, in fact, it’s the opposite, more games should put the ball in the player’s court, even if that means not always catering to the lowest common denominator.
I recruited a bruiser named Chris Kincaid. He was an arena fighter I had beaten in an underground fight pit. He dealt more damage in melee combat than most people. Chris was tough, and his melee attacks even staggered nearby enemies. The first time I played as Chris, I stood outside of an Albion-infested area I needed to infiltrate and hack something inside.
I was thinking about how I wanted to play him. Chris was a big dude, he had a mohawk and wore a leather jacket with a skull on the back. When I was thinking about who he was, I couldn’t imagine him hacking the cameras, sneaking around, or even drawing a gun. No, there was no way this guy didn’t just walk through the front door and punch the guard behind it.
So equipped with some electric knuckles, the first guard was quite shocked when Chris walked in. Most of the time, enemies won’t escalate to guns right away unless you do. So as the next guard came running Chris jammed his optics which allowed Chris to take him down quickly and brutally.
He dispatched a few more in melee combat. He didn’t really sneak around much, but he still caught a couple of guards unaware and body-slammed them because that’s how he rolled.
That’s how I played any mission with Chris. Sometimes it worked, other times it didn’t, like that time when he got a hostage killed. And finally, one mission it cost him his life. But it always felt true to him.
More than that, playing my operatives in this way kept the game from being repetitive. There’s nothing stopping you from grabbing a single operative, hooking them up with some guns and tech, and playing them the exact same way all through the game. Especially if you don’t have permadeath enabled. But that’s missing the point.
Intentionally engaging the systems Watch Dogs Legion presents to you, will make it far more enjoyable. In fact, I think playing without permadeath is a mistake, regardless of what difficulty you chose. Not only does it add stakes to your gameplay, but without it, you have much less reason to recruit at all.
Freeing up boroughs always grants you a specialist of some kind, and without permadeath, you will never lose them. At most, they might get arrested or injured for an hour, but that’s it. The game feels designed for permadeath.
If you care about these operatives and step into who they are, there is a lot of fun to be had. You can even get some information on them. Knowing that Chris was an ex-BDSM model didn’t really help my playstyle, but hey, I knew about it!
It’s more than just a bit of roleplaying though, the melee combat is kind of shallow. You just have some light attacks, a guard breaker, dodge, and counter-attack. The combat animations and stealth takedowns are super cool, but each character has a limited variety. If you only played one character, it would feel thin. But it’s really not.
Chris body slammed people, my hitman choked people out with a fiber wire or pulled John Wick style gun executions. My doctor zapped guards with a deliberator while my Hypnotist put them to sleep. The variety is there, it’s up to you to utilize it.
There is no denying that the story does lose some cohesion without a stable protagonist. The dialogue doesn’t always run together smoothly because the game has no idea what type of person you’re going to be using at any given time.
But the fact of the matter is, there is a protagonist. It’s DedSec, it’s your team. Once you realize that other members are watching you through a feed, it makes more sense. Your entire team is experiencing the same story beats as the character you’re playing as.
If Watch Dogs Legion was a movie, it would be a team film. You would see one operative rescuing a hostage from a gang before the camera flips over to another one in a high-speed chase. It’s another factor you miss if you only ever play as one character.
Even knowing that. The story still isn’t winning any awards, but it is entertaining. If you were turned off by the meme-style tone of Watch Dogs 2, you will be happier here. Despite the wise-cracking AI companion called Bagley, the tone is much darker and even disturbing at times.
The second half of Legion’s ambition is less impactful than the recruitment system but, it’s still interesting. The game tracks people close to you, whether they are connected to your operatives or on the list of potential recruits you saved for later.
They have families, friends, and schedules. They go to work, on dates, and more. You can track them down at any time and see them in action. If you rescue or hurt someone connected to one of these people, it affects their relationship with you. I’ve earned the trust of recruits by helping out their loved ones, and I’ve made enemies by accidentally hurting them.
One, in particular, hated me so much that they kidnapped one of my operatives, and I had to go rescue them. Sadly that’s about as far as the simulation go’s toward affecting gameplay, but it still helps create the feeling of a living world.
I had one guy on my list of potential recruits that was neutral toward DedSec. When I was ready to recruit him, I found that he was mad at DedSec, I could still work toward recruiting him, but it would be more difficult. Why? One of my operatives gave him an STI. I had NOTHING to do with that, but I still appreciated that the world existed without me, or at least it was pretending to.
This type of simulation feels like it’s in its infancy, and I hope it’s something Ubisoft expands upon in a future game. Much like Shadow of War expanded on Shadow of Mordor’s nemesis system. There’s so much potential there.
The melee combat may be shallow, but the stealth, gunplay, and hacking are all solid, if familiar. The real game-changer to your play style is the type of operative you’re playing since they can have a wide variety of traits and weapons.
That said, you can unlock tech with tech points and equip any operative with some neat gear, and they all have access to at least some hacks. This affords you a great deal of leeway in how you approach the objectives.
You can go in guns blazing, stealthy, or a combination of the two. You can hack the camera network, or utilize a spider bot and never even enter the premises. There is a lot of room for creative ideas as well, such as hacking a news drone and sticking a shock mine to it for a remote-controlled non-lethal missile.
The moment-to-moment gameplay is a ton of fun if you lean into the operative system. While most of the side missions seemed to be procedurally generated recruitment missions. I actually opened up even more side missions later in the game, and they are pretty interesting.
However, it’s the core gameplay that also falters a bit. I’ve talked a lot about the player’s commitment to the mechanics, but Watch Dogs Legion has commitment issues of its own.
It often dips its toe into potentially polarizing mechanics, only to quickly rip it out and scream “It’s just a prank bro!” at any given moment. For example, most of the enemy-controlled areas have all sorts of entrances. one handy use of a construction worker is the fact they can call cargo drones allowing you to literally fly.
Well, the game wouldn’t think of inconveniencing you, so they invalidate that ability by placing cargo drone pads everywhere. Thus, anyone can summon one, and oftentimes, that is clearly going to be the most effective option, making the other entry points moot.
A spider bot is one of the gadgets you can equip, but if you don’t have one, fear not. There will be a box where you can summon one literally five feet any time a spider bot can be used. It made me wonder why it was a gadget I could choose in the first place since the game always had a free one ready for me. It really doesn’t help that it’s a bit overpowered, since it’s able to clear many areas without ever risking your operative.
Quite a few missions took my agency away altogether by requiring and providing a specific drone for it. I could play these missions as a low-mobility grandma, a spy, a hitman, or big old Chris, and they would play the exact same way regardless of who I was, and that’s disappointing.
It really felt like Watch Dogs Legion had a vision, but they had to hit that mass-market appeal check box, so some mechanics were compromised. Yes, you can ignore those spider bot spawns or cargo drone pads, and roleplaying your operatives as I mentioned earlier helps with that. But you shouldn’t have to.
There should never be a case in a game about player choice where the most effective solution is plastered on a giant billboard with neon letters that reads “LOOK HERE, DUMMY!” Yet Watch Dogs Legion does exactly that.
Despite my griping, I still think Watch Dogs Legion is a great game with new ideas, and that makes it worth picking up. Yet there is one more issue I need to address.
The bloody crashing. I am quite impressed by how well the game runs on my standard Xbox One. It looks good and runs well, but it crashes frequently. It’s more than annoying, it can be infuriating. I’ve never lost any progress, and I expect that it will be addressed within days, but it’s pretty bad as I am writing this.
Watch Dogs Legion is a solid if familiar title. However, the innovative recruitment system and neat simulation elevate the experience into something novel and worth experiencing, even if the game doesn’t always commit to its design the way it expects players to.
Thanks to our Patrons

DevSecOps builds on the ideas of DevOps by applying security practices throughout the software development lifecycle to ship more secure code faster.
Through collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, DevSecOps offers a set of practices that help companies embed security into their work to build more secure, high-quality software at scale.
DevOps has transformed how many organizations build and ship software. But until recently one aspect of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) has remained outside DevOps: security. DevSecOps seeks to correct that by baking security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) in the same way that DevOps prioritizes quality, speed, and deep collaboration throughout all stages of software development. For modern organizations, DevSecOps becomes just âDevOpsâ: security is baked into the SDLC experience.
Organizations that adopt DevSecOps typically see advantages that include:
Reduced risk of data breaches: 
DevSecOps seeks to make code secure by design. A combination of secure coding cultural practices, secure developer environments, and automated security tests throughout the SDLC help reduce the chances of security vulnerabilities or flaws making it into production software.
Improved compliance: 
DevSecOps practitioners often use automation to enforce code compliance and integrate policy enforcement tooling directly into the CI/CD pipeline.
Greater confidence in dependencies: 
The modern technology stack depends heavily on third-party code, often from public package repositories. DevSecOps practitioners frequently leverage tooling and automated tests to identify potential issues before a software release.
Value gets to end users faster: 
By creating a security-first culture and applying automated checks, DevSecOps reduces the need for distinct security reviews that slow down code deployments.
DevSecOps seeks to build security into every step of the SDLC. This ideally means that security related tests (automated and not) take place at each stage from coding to merging branches to builds, deployments, and on into operation of production software. Moreover, DevSecOps advances the idea that everyone working on a product is accountable for its security. This helps teams catch vulnerabilities before they make it to production and reduces the need for late-stage, manual security reviews, which can slow down software releases.
Push buggy code into production and the result might be a bad customer experience and potential lost business due to downtime. But if you deploy insecure code, the fallout can be far more severe.
DevSecOps is a natural evolution of DevOps and seeks to make security a core part of the SDLC instead of a siloed process that takes place right before a release. Just like how testing and operations teams were often siloed from development in the pre-DevOps world, security today is often the job of specialized teams whose work take place outside the DevOps lifecycle. 
DevSecOps argues that security needs to be embedded across the SDLC. Whether your organization already practices DevOps or youâre looking at how to adopt a DevOps culture, here are the foundational best practices you need to establish a DevSecOps practice:
Create a DevSecOps culture: Success in DevSecOps relies on everyone taking responsibility for security. That means each person in the SDLC codes, builds, tests, and configures application and infrastructure settings defensively. Just like DevOps, DevSecOps thrives in an open culture where each individual works together to build the best and most secure product possible.
Design security into the product: DevSecOps seeks to design security into products from the initial planning stages to deployed production-level code. This means security work is planned alongside feature work, and practitioners are provided security knowledge and testing throughout each stage of their development work. The goal is to make security an everyday part of your teamâs work.
Build a threat modeling practice: The seeds of security vulnerabilities are often sown before a line of code is written. Model potential threats during the planning phase and design your infrastructure and the applicationâs architecture to mitigate those issues. And periodic penetration testing, where a trusted person attempts to break into your system, can help unveil weaknesses you may miss in your threat models.
Automate for speed and security: Automated testing is used throughout the SDLC to ensure the right security checks happen at the right time. That gives people more time to focus on building the core product while ensuring security requirements are met.
Plan security checkpoints in your product development: 
Identify transition points in your SDLC where the risk profile changes. That could be the point at which a developer merges their code into the main branch, which might increase the potential for that code to be run on the machines of colleagues and eventually reach production. In that case, opening a pull request might be a good trigger event for automated security checks, along with the appropriate manual escalations.
Approach security failures as learning opportunities: 
Building on DevOpsâ culture of continuous improvement, a successful DevSecOps practice strives to turn security incidents into learning opportunities. This can be accomplished by leveraging audit logs, building incident reports, and modeling malicious behavior to improve tooling, testing, and processes to further secure your applications and systems. 
Stay on top of dependencies: 
Understanding and mitigating the potential threats from dependencies is critical to your productâs security. Apply the same threat modeling and automated testing to your dependencies as to your in-house code. At GitHub weâve identified and shared details of tens of millions of threats in open source software, helping organizations and developers be more aware of and avoid vulnerabilities. 
Build your analytics and reporting capabilities: 
Continuous monitoring is a critical part of a DevSecOps practiceâand that includes real-time alerts, system analytics, and proactive threat monitoring. By measuring every aspect of your application and your DevSecOps pipeline you can create a common point for understanding application health. Reporting dashboards and alerts highlight problems early. When a problem does occur, the telemetry youâve set upâsuch as application-level loggingâprovides insight for incident resolution and root cause analysis.
Creating a DevSecOps culture begins by making security everyoneâs responsibility. This can be a big change for many organizations. Traditionally, security was something developers left in the hands of specialist security professionals. It could also become a point of friction as well. Engineering teams often looked at security practices as an impediment to shipping software fast.
DevSecOps fundamentally seeks to change this perception by making security as core to the SDLC as writing code, running tests, configuring services. Each new feature or fix begins with considering its security implications. Security and compliance policies are enforced through tests. When something goes wrong, itâs an opportunity to learn and to do it better next time.
And instead of something that slows down software releases, security in a DevSecOps practice becomes a part of the release itself leading to faster and more secure deployments.
But building a successful DevSecOps practice requires building security into every stage of the SDLC. This varies from one organization to another. Even so, there are core pillars that define a DevSecOps culture. These include: 
People: 
A DevSecOps practice seeks to remove the barriers between different disciplines and build a naturally collaborative environment where  each person shares responsibility for a productâs security and quality.
Process: 
DevSecOps moves security from being a distinct stage that often comes at the end of the SDLC to an integral part of each personâs work. Automated security evaluations, security-focused unit testing, widespread monitoring, and defensive coding create rapid feedback loops where vulnerabilities are surfaced earlier in the product life cycle and can be fixed faster.
Products: 
DevSecOps builds on the DevOps toolchain by using technologies such as CI/CD to automate the identification of security issues. Dependency scanning, static and dynamic application security testing, and automated policy enforcement tools are often used to help build security into every stage of the SDLC. A wide range of best-in-breed solutions can be integrated with one another to create an âopenâ toolchain. Other organizations, however, may find that more integrated and security-focused product suites can often provide a more holistic experience.
Governance: 
Continuous improvement is central to DevSecOps and it requires creating a culture of measurement that enables practitioners to identify opportunities to refine processes and tooling.
A DevSecOps culture seeks to establish security as a fundamental part of creating softwareâbut thatâs only one part of what it takes to successfully adopt a DevSecOps practice. The next step is to integrate security into each stage of a DevOps pipeline.
With security specific tooling and processes throughout the SDLC, a DevSecOps pipeline helps practitioners design more secure products and catch security issues early in the product life cycle. 

DevSecOps builds on DevOps, and a DevSecOps pipeline builds on a DevOps pipeline. Just as DevOps integrated quality and speed into each step, the best DevSecOps pipelines are designed to anticipate key points in the SDLC where security issues are likely to arise.
This breaks down into the following common DevSecOps pipeline stages: 
Plan: 
In a DevSecOps practice, security starts at the planning stage in the SDLC pipeline. This can include analyzing potential security threats and determining how to combat them with threat modeling. It can also involve designing security into your products proactively to ensure itâs baked into the work from the beginning with key data hygiene and other security decisions taken up front. 
Code: 
At the coding stage in a DevSecOps pipeline, itâs important to create a culture of defensive programming with policies that help practitioners proactively navigate security and compliance issues. This could be as simple as specifying rules for how to handle particularly risky aspects of code, such as NULLs, or involve broader guidelines on areas such as input validation. 
Build: 
In the build stage, a typical DevSecOps pipeline will include automated security checks to catch vulnerabilities in source code before they hit the main branch. This can involve using pre-commit hooks to run static application security testing (SAST) tools where any potential issues in code will stop the build, much like a failed test, and provide time to fix any potential vulnerabilities in proprietary source code before work can progress. It should also include software composition analysis (SCA) tools to track open source components in the codebase and detect any vulnerabilities in dependencies. 
Test: 
The test stage of a DevSecOps pipeline is a key point where practitioners will develop a testing strategy and automated testing suite to catch any potential security vulnerabilities or issues. This commonly includes using unit tests at a base level to look for security issues such as the way in which the application deals with unexpected or malformed input. It can also include dynamic application security tests to find vulnerabilities in the application when run. This way, the test phase becomes as much as security as it does functionality. A good tip at this stage is to integrate dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the DevSecOps pipeline.
Release: 
In the release stage, a DevSecOps pipeline will often include additional automated security testing and vulnerability scanning to catch issues that might not have been apparent in earlier stages. Some organizations will also deploy the principle of least privilege where each person and tool has access only to precisely what they need. 
Deploy: 
At the deployment stage, a DevSecOps practitioner will work to ensure that code makes it to production only if it has passed security checks at each previous stage. This can involve applying automated tests to application code and the underlying infrastructure used to run the software in production to catch any run-time security concerns.
Operate and monitor: 
In the operations and monitoring stages of a DevSecOps pipeline, organizations will often use application-level and infrastructure metrics to identify unusual activity that could indicate a security breach. When an incident occurs, use logging and other instrumentation can be used to pinpoint the issue and understand its impact.
When itâs correctly implemented, automation accelerates the SDLC by enabling people to use technology to accomplish repetitive, manual tasks and deliver higher-quality software faster. DevSecOps takes automation further by integrating security tests across all stages of the SDLC to improve speed, consistency, and mitigate against potential risks. 
If DevSecOps makes security everyoneâs responsibility, DevSecOps automation strives to give everyone the tools they need to ensure code and configurations are secure without requiring them to become security specialists.
When considering where to apply automation in your own DevSecOps pipeline, consider the following principles:
Automation should be strategic: 
A DevOps practice often seeks to use automation to facilitate speed and quality across the SDLC. But just as being strategic is important in a DevOps practice, itâs equallyâif not moreâimportant to be strategic about how and when automation is applied in a DevSecOps environment. 
Let people focus on being creative: 
Automate repetitive tasks wherever possible. That way, people can save their time and mental energy for more involved work while checks are applied more consistently and at scale.
Systematize code review: 
Use tools such as static application security testing to automate elements of your code review. Human-led code review is still important though and itâs critical to ensure your code review checklist covers security issues specific to your technology stack. Create a feedback cycle so each time a new information becomes available you build it into the checklist. For example, when an incident occurs consider how you could have caught the problem earlier with a code review or automated test.

Adopting DevSecOps starts with a cultural shift that involves making security a core concern of everyone involved in the SDLC. To accomplish this, organizations will often adopt new processes and build a DevSecOps toolchain that applies automated security tests and security tooling to the SDLC.
DevSecOps tooling often builds on common DevOps tools such as CI/CD, automated tests, configuration management, and monitoring. The goal is to integrate security-focused tooling into each stage of the product life cycle. 
Automated security tests on commits and merges: 
A basic goal of any DevSecOps practice is to catch issues in code before they can do harm by triggering automatic scans using pre-commit and merge triggers. Some of the scans organizations might implement include:
Code scanning: Often called static application security testing, this evaluates code at restâin other words, without having to run itâto discover code that could lead to a vulnerability.
Vulnerability scanning: Dynamic application scanning tools build and deploy the application to a sandboxed environment and then observe how it responds to known security threats.
Secret scanning: Even with the most stringent policies, secrets occasionally make it into a commit. Secret scanning tools are used to catch them before the commit is made. These also pair with SCA tools, which are used to detect any vulnerabilities in open source dependencies within a given codebase.

Find out how GitHub helps DevSecOps organizations manage application and system configurations through automation > 
Container orchestration: In some environments, organizations may adopt a microservices architecture to better support complex, cloud-native applications. This requires maintaining multiple containers and scaling them as needed and securelyâand that involves container orchestration tools. Just like configuration management tools, container orchestration tooling will often use YAML configuration files to dictate interactions between containers. 
Runtime verification: Also known as runtime application self-protection tools, these tools will actively monitor and/or direct threats towards your application as it runs with reports highlighting any vulnerabilities.
Continuous monitoring and reporting: One of the simplest yet highly effective aspects of DevSecOps tooling is measurementâand that involves logging everything at the application and infrastructure level. The best tools will provide real-time intelligence when something goes wrong and include a reporting system so you can catch issues early. Outbound data from an unexpected port, for example, could indicate a compromise but without monitoring and reporting it might go undetected.
Security is a defining issue in software development organizations today. Getting it wrong has far-reaching implicationsâboth for the organizations and even the individuals involved. DevSecOps offers a framework for creating software securely from the very first step. And building on the well understood culture and processes of DevOps means that, for most businesses, a shift left to DevSecOps is a natural evolution.
GitHub is an integrated platform that takes companies from idea to planning to building to production, combining a focused developer experience with powerful, fully managed development, automation, and test infrastructure.

Your email address will only be passed to third parties, if you have given your express consent to do so in order to receive newsletters about certain products or services of these third parties.
When subscribing to our newsletter we will ask you to enter your email address in the registration mask. We will use such data solely to provide you with our newsletter.
When you subscribe to our newsletter, your IP address and the date and time of the registration will also be automatically stored on our servers. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the email address of a user at a later date, and it therefore serves us to prove that our registration process is in line with legal requirements.
After you have submitted your newsletter request, we will send a confirmation email to the given email address. This confirmation email contains a link that you need to click on to confirm your subscription. This so-called double-opt-in-procedure helps us to ensure that the email-account holder has actually authorised the receipt of our newsletter.
We use technical service providers which help us managing the newsletter subscriptions and providing related marketing services (âNewsletter Service Providersâ). This includes service providers which may have their registered seat and servers in a state outside of the European Union e.g. in the USA. However, we exclusively work with companies that offer an appropriate data protection level in line with the stipulations of the GDPR. You can find further information relating to the sharing of data to third parties outside of the European Union underÂ Section 11.4.
Currently we work with the following Newsletter Service Providers:
Our Newsletter Service Provider will process your email addresses and other personal data as described in section 5.3 as our data processor only on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions to help us evaluate the usage of our newsletter, to personalize your newsletter communications, to compile reports on newsletter activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to the usage of our newsletter. Our Newsletter Service Providers are in no way authorised to use the data of our newsletter subscribers in order to contact them themselves or to forward the data to third parties.
We will track and evaluate your usage of our newsletter, such as email-opens and email-clicks, by means of a tracking technology made available by the Newsletter Service Provider. For this purpose the HTML-emails sent with our newsletter may contain web beacons (also called pixel tags, tracking pixel or GIFs), automatically embedded by our Newsletter Service Providers. A web beacon is a small graphic that contains unique identifiers that allow an analysis of the success or failure of our Newsletter campaigns. Our Service Provider records each subscribers email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click in order to provide us with aggregated reports about how an email campaign performed and what actions subscribers took.
As part of your registration, we may ask for your consent to tailor the content of our newsletter to your personal interests. This is done by evaluating the data about your interactions with our newsletter and your use of this Website. That means that the pseudonymous Usage Data, we collected about you in the past and we will collect in the future will be attributed to your email address. This single record helps us to understand your needs and preferences even better so that we can adjust the contents of the newsletter optimally to your personal interests and to provide you with relevant content. We only combine your data as described and provide you with personalized content, if we have your express consent to do so.
The wording of your consent declaration given when subscribing for our newsletter can be viewed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
We will retain your personal data for the stated purposes as long as your subscription to our newsletter is active. You may cancel your newsletter subscription and withdraw your consent in that regard at any time either via the link provided at the bottom of each newsletter or by sending an email to: datenschutz@cuponation.com.
If you merely would like to opt-out of the newsletter tracking you may configure your email program in a way that emails are presented in text form instead of HTML format. This way the web beacons will not be able to work. You can also configure your browser settings in a way that no cookies are stored on your computer. Web beacons typically only work in conjunction with cookies. However, in these cases the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full and you may not be able to use all functions.
From time to time you may have the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests, raffles or similar promotional activities (âPromotional Activitiesâ) through this Website. We typically ask you for certain personal data in order for you to participate in such Promotional Activities, such as your name, surname, age, address, phone number, social media account, consumer behaviour and/or email address. We collect this information solely to administer the respective Promotional Activity (e.g. to verify your eligibility, to determine the winner and to present the award and/or to publish the winnerÂ´s name on this Website), unless you have given your explicit consent to use such data for specified other purposes. All Promotional Activities conducted via this Website are subject to the terms and conditions of each individual Promotional Activity. Such terms and conditions may provide additional information related to the processing of your personal data. Unless expressly otherwise specified, personal data collected by us in respect of Promotional Activities will not be stored any longer than is required to fulfill the purpose of the respective Promotional Activity.
As we finance ourselves through commissions, we may receive information from our business partners (e.g. merchants) about your online purchases, which you may place on websites of third parties (e.g. online-shops) after a visit to this Website. Such information is transmitted to us automatically with the help of tracking cookies. We never receive information that can directly identify you but merely commission related information such as the value of your purchase and date and time of the transaction. We also work with several so-called affiliate networks (âAffiliate Networksâ), which connect us with merchants and take over the technical and billing process. In these cases we receive the respective information from such Affiliate Networks. We solely use this information for billing purposes.
Under certain circumstances our business partners offer you the possibility to redeem vouchers for goods or services offered on their website. If you have created a shopping basket but have not checked-out yet, and subsequently call this Website, some business partners may share information regarding your open shopping basket (for example purchase value and product category). For this purpose we and our respective business partners use a technology (DoubleClick for Publishers) provided by Google Inc. This technology enables us to tailor and display vouchers on this website based on the content of your shopping basket. This form of advertising is carried out completely automatically and does not allow us to draw any conclusions about your identity. We can merely stipulate general criteria of the segmentation, such as product categories, on the basis of which certain vouchers are issued. For detailed information on Google DoubleClick for Publishers and how to prevent the processing of your data by Google, please seeÂ Section 10.2.
When you first visit this Website, we will inform you about the use of cookies and similar technologies served through this website and ask for your consent to the use of such cookies.

You may find the following Plugins on this Website:
The Plugins can be clearly identified as they feature the logo of the associated Social Network/Platform (e.g. white âfâ on blue background for Facebook).
The integration of Plugins enables the respective Social Network or Platform to collect data about you as you access a website that contains the respective Plugin. Your browser will establish a direct connection to the servers of the respective Social Network/Platform. We have no influence on the extent of the data collected by these Social Networks/Platforms via the Plugins. If you visit a website that contains a Plugin while you are logged in with the corresponding Social Network/Platform, the provider of such Social Network/Platform will be able to correlate your account data with information about your visit to the respective website (including your IP address). This information is transmitted directly to the servers of the respective providers. In addition information you intended to share with Social Networks will be published and shown to your contacts on these Social Networks. For further information, please refer to the privacy policy of the respective Social Networks and Platforms.

“Free software” means software that respects users'
freedom and community.  Roughly, it means that the users have the
freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the
software.  Thus, “free software” is a matter of
liberty, not price.  To understand the concept, you should think of
“free” as in “free speech,” not as in
“free beer.”  We sometimes call it “libre
software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for
“free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software
is gratis.


You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may
have obtained copies at no charge.  But regardless of how you got your
copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software,
even to sell copies.


We campaign for these freedoms because everyone deserves them.  With
these freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control
the program and what it does for them.  When users don't control the
program, we call it a “nonfree” or
“proprietary” program.  The nonfree program controls the
users, and the developer controls the program; this makes the
program 
an instrument of unjust power.


“Open source” is something different: it has a very
different philosophy based on different values.  Its practical
definition is different too, but nearly all open source programs are
in fact free.  We explain the
difference in 
Why “Open Source” misses the point of Free Software.

The free software definition presents the criteria for whether a
particular software program qualifies as free software.  From time to
time we revise this definition, to clarify it or to resolve questions
about subtle issues.  See the History section
below for a list of changes that affect the definition of free
software.


A program is free software if the program's users have the
four essential freedoms: [1]


A program is free software if it gives users adequately all of these
freedoms.  Otherwise, it is nonfree.  While we can distinguish various
nonfree distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of
being free, we consider them all equally unethical.
In any given scenario, these freedoms must apply to whatever code
we plan to make use of, or lead others to make use of.  For instance,
consider a program A which automatically launches a program B to
handle some cases.  If we plan to distribute A as it stands, that
implies users will need B, so we need to judge whether both A and B
are free.  However, if we plan to modify A so that it doesn't use B,
only A needs to be free; B is not pertinent to that plan.

“Free software” does not mean “noncommercial.”
On the contrary, a free program must be available for commercial use,
commercial development, and commercial distribution.  This policy is
of fundamental importance—without this, free software could not
achieve its aims.


We want to invite everyone to use the GNU system, including businesses
and their workers.  That requires allowing commercial use.  We hope
that free replacement programs will supplant comparable proprietary
programs, but they can't do that if businesses are forbidden to use
them.  We want commercial products that contain software to include
the GNU system, and that would constitute commercial distribution for
a price.  Commercial development of free software is no longer
unusual; such free commercial software is very important.  Paid,
professional support for free software fills an important need.


Thus, to exclude commercial use, commercial development or commercial
distribution would hobble the free software community and obstruct its
path to success.  We must conclude that a program licensed with such
restrictions does not qualify as free software.


A free program must offer the four freedoms to any would-be user that
obtains a copy of the software, who has complied thus far with the
conditions of the free license covering the software in any previous
distribution of it.  Putting some of the freedoms off limits to some
users, or requiring that users pay, in money or in kind, to exercise
them, is tantamount to not granting the freedoms in question, and thus
renders the program nonfree.

In the rest of this article we explain more precisely how far the
various freedoms need to extend, on various issues, in order for a
program to be free.

The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person
or organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind of
overall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it
with the developer or any other specific entity.  In this freedom, it is
the user's purpose that matters, not the developer's
purpose; you as a user are free to run the program for your purposes,
and if you distribute it to other people, they are then free to run it for
their purposes, but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on them.


The freedom to run the program as you wish means that you are not
forbidden or stopped from making it run.  This has nothing to do with what
functionality the program has, whether it is technically capable of
functioning in any given environment, or whether it is useful for any
particular computing activity.
For example, if the code arbitrarily rejects certain meaningful
inputs—or even fails unconditionally—that may make the
program less useful, perhaps even totally useless, but it does not
deny users the freedom to run the program, so it does not conflict
with freedom 0.  If the program is free, the users can overcome the
loss of usefulness, because freedoms 1 and 3 permit users and
communities to make and distribute modified versions without the
arbitrary nuisance code.
“As you wish” includes, optionally, “not at
all” if that is what you wish.  So there is no need for a
separate “freedom not to run a program.”

In order for freedoms 1 and 3 (the freedom to make changes and the
freedom to publish the changed versions) to be meaningful, you need to have
access to the source code of the program.  Therefore, accessibility of
source code is a necessary condition for free software.  Obfuscated
“source code” is not real source code and does not count
as source code.


Source code is defined as the preferred form of the program for making
changes in.  Thus, whatever form a developer changes to develop
the program is the source code of that developer's version.


Freedom 1 includes the freedom to use your changed version in place of
the original.  If the program is delivered in a product designed to
run someone else's modified versions but refuse to run yours—a
practice known as “tivoization” or “lockdown,”
or (in its practitioners' perverse terminology) as “secure
boot”—freedom 1 becomes an empty pretense rather than a
practical reality.  These binaries are not free
software even if the source code they are compiled from is free.


One important way to modify a program is by merging in available free
subroutines and modules.  If the program's license says that you
cannot merge in a suitably licensed existing module—for instance, if it
requires you to be the copyright holder of any code you add—then the
license is too restrictive to qualify as free.


Whether a change constitutes an improvement is a subjective matter.
If your right to modify a program is limited, in substance, to changes that
someone else considers an improvement, that program is not free.


One special case of freedom 1 is to delete the program's code so it
returns after doing nothing, or make it invoke some other program.
Thus, freedom 1 includes the “freedom to delete the program.”

Freedom to distribute (freedoms 2 and 3) means you are free to
redistribute copies, either with or without modifications, either
gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to
anyone anywhere.  Being free to do these
things means (among other things) that you do not have to ask or pay
for permission to do so.


You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them
privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they
exist.  If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to
notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way.


Freedom 3 includes the freedom to release your modified versions
as free software.  A free license may also permit other ways of
releasing them; in other words, it does not have to be
a copyleft license.  However, a
license that requires modified versions to be nonfree does not qualify
as a free license.


The freedom to redistribute copies must include binary or executable
forms of the program, as well as source code, for both modified and
unmodified versions.  (Distributing programs in runnable form is necessary
for conveniently installable free operating systems.)  It is OK if there
is no way to produce a binary or executable form for a certain program
(since some languages don't support that feature), but you must have the
freedom to redistribute such forms should you find or develop a way to
make them.


Certain kinds of rules about the manner of distributing free
software are acceptable, when they don't conflict with the central
freedoms.  For example, copyleft
(very simply stated) is the rule that when redistributing the program,
you cannot add restrictions to deny other people the central freedoms.
This rule does not conflict with the central freedoms; rather it
protects them.


In the GNU project, we use copyleft to protect the four freedoms
legally for everyone.  We believe there are important reasons why
it is better to use
copyleft.  However,

noncopylefted free software is ethical
too.  See Categories of Free
Software for a description of how “free software,”
“copylefted software” and other categories of software
relate to each other.


Rules about how to package a modified version are acceptable,
if they don't substantively limit your freedom to release modified
versions, or your freedom to make and use modified versions privately.
Thus, it is acceptable for the license to require that you change the
name of the modified version, remove a logo, or identify your
modifications as yours.  As long as these requirements are not so
burdensome that they effectively hamper you from releasing your
changes, they are acceptable; you're already making other changes to
the program, so you won't have trouble making a few more.


Rules that “if you make your version available in this way, you
must make it available in that way also” can be acceptable too,
on the same condition.  An example of such an acceptable rule is one
saying that if you have distributed a
modified version and a previous developer asks for a copy of it, you
must send one.  (Note that such a rule still leaves you the choice of
whether to distribute your version at all.)  Rules that require release
of source code to the users for versions that you put into public use
are also acceptable.


A special issue arises when a license requires changing the name by
which the program will be invoked from other programs.  That
effectively hampers you from releasing your changed version so that it
can replace the original when invoked by those other programs.  This
sort of requirement is acceptable only if there's a suitable aliasing
facility that allows you to specify the original program's name as an
alias for the modified version.

Sometimes government export control regulations
and trade sanctions can constrain your freedom to distribute copies of
programs internationally.  Software developers do not have the power to
eliminate or override these restrictions, but what they can and must do
is refuse to impose them as conditions of use of the program.  In this
way, the restrictions will not affect activities and people outside the
jurisdictions of these governments.  Thus, free software licenses
must not require obedience to any nontrivial export regulations as a
condition of exercising any of the essential freedoms.


Merely mentioning the existence of export regulations, without making
them a condition of the license itself, is acceptable since it does
not restrict users.  If an export regulation is actually trivial for
free software, then requiring it as a condition is not an actual
problem; however, it is a potential problem, since a later change in
export law could make the requirement nontrivial and thus render the
software nonfree.


In order for these freedoms to be real, they must be permanent and
irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong; if the developer of the
software has the power to revoke the license, or retroactively add
restrictions to its terms, without your doing anything wrong to give
cause, the software is not free.


A free license may not require compliance with the license of a
nonfree program.  Thus, for instance, if a license requires you to
comply with the licenses of “all the programs you use,” in
the case of a user that runs nonfree programs this would require
compliance with the licenses of those nonfree programs; that makes the
license nonfree.


It is acceptable for a free license to specify which jurisdiction's
law applies, or where litigation must be done, or both.


Most free software licenses are based on copyright, and there are limits
on what kinds of requirements can be imposed through copyright.  If a
copyright-based license respects freedom in the ways described above, it
is unlikely to have some other sort of problem that we never anticipated
(though this does happen occasionally).  However, some free software
licenses are based on contracts, and contracts can impose a much larger
range of possible restrictions.  That means there are many possible ways
such a license could be unacceptably restrictive and nonfree.


We can't possibly list all the ways that might happen.  If a
contract-based license restricts the user in an unusual way that
copyright-based licenses cannot, and which isn't mentioned here as
legitimate, we will have to think about it, and we will probably conclude
it is nonfree.


Note that criteria such as those stated in this free software
definition require careful thought for their interpretation.  To decide
whether a specific software license qualifies as a free software license,
we judge it based on these criteria to determine whether it fits their
spirit as well as the precise words.  If a license includes unconscionable
restrictions, we reject it, even if we did not anticipate the issue
in these criteria.  Sometimes a license requirement raises an issue
that calls for extensive thought, including discussions with a lawyer,
before we can decide if the requirement is acceptable.  When we reach
a conclusion about a new issue, we often update these criteria to make
it easier to see why certain licenses do or don't qualify.


If you are interested in whether a specific license qualifies as a free
software license, see our list
of licenses.  If the license you are concerned with is not
listed there, you can ask us about it by sending us email at 
<licensing@gnu.org>.


If you are contemplating writing a new license, please contact the
Free Software Foundation first by writing to that address. The
proliferation of different free software licenses means increased work
for users in understanding the licenses; we may be able to help you
find an existing free software license that meets your needs.


If that isn't possible, if you really need a new license, with our
help you can ensure that the license really is a free software license
and avoid various practical problems.


When talking about free software, it is best to avoid using terms
like “give away” or “for free,” because those terms imply that
the issue is about price, not freedom.  Some common terms such
as “piracy” embody opinions we hope you won't endorse.  See 
Confusing Words and Phrases that
are Worth Avoiding for a discussion of these terms.  We also have
a list of proper translations of
“free software” into various languages.


Another group uses the term “open source” to mean
something close (but not identical) to “free software.”  We
prefer the term “free software” because, once you have heard that
it refers to freedom rather than price, it calls to mind freedom.  The
word “open” never refers to freedom.


Software manuals must be free,
for the same reasons that software must be free, and because the
manuals are in effect part of the software.


The same arguments also make sense for other kinds of works of
practical use—that is to say, works that embody useful knowledge,
such as educational works and reference
works.  Wikipedia is the best-known
example.


Any kind of work can be free, and the definition of free software
has been extended to a definition of 
free cultural works applicable to any kind of works.

From time to time we revise this Free Software Definition.  Here is
the list of substantive changes, along with links to show exactly what
was changed.
There are gaps in the version numbers shown above because there are
other changes in this page that do not affect the definition or its
interpretations.  For instance, the list does not include changes in
asides, formatting, spelling, punctuation, or other parts of the page.

GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as
defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and
sign your data and communications; it features a versatile key management
system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key
directories.  GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with
features for easy integration with other applications.  A wealth of
frontend applications and libraries are available.  GnuPG also
provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell (ssh).


Since its introduction in 1997, GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that
it respects your freedom). It can be freely used, modified and
distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License .


The current version of GnuPG is 2.4.4.  See the download
page for other maintained versions.


Gpg4win is a Windows version of GnuPG featuring a context menu tool, a
crypto manager, and an Outlook plugin to send and receive standard
PGP/MIME mails.  The current version of Gpg4win is .


Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy
because you have nothing to hide is no different from
saying you don't care about free speech because you have
nothing to say.   – Edward Snowden


Using encryption helps to protect your privacy and the privacy of the
people you communicate with.  Encryption makes life difficult for bulk
surveillance systems.  GnuPG is one of the tools that Snowden used to
uncover the secrets of the NSA.

Mission Pack: The Reckoning

Â 


In the first official expansion pack for Quake II, you are part of an elite commando force that must infiltrate a Strogg site. Once inside, you must scour industrial landscapes, crawl through waterways and air ducts, navigate treacherous canyons teeming with vicious mutants, stow away on an alien spacecraft, and destroy the enemy's secret moon base.


Â 

Mission Pack: Ground Zero

Â 


In the second official expansion pack for Quake II, you, and a few marines are the lucky ones. You've made it to the surface of Stroggos in one piece and are still able to contact the fleet. The Gravity Well, the Strogg's newest weapon in its arsenal against mankind, is operational. With the fleet trapped around Stroggos, only 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number dwindling by the second, your orders have changed: free your comrades and destroy the Gravity Well.

It might happen that someone encrypted a mail for another recipient but mistakenly sent it to you and so you're not able to read it. Or a signed message you're receiving was modified without your knowledge. Or anything else could have gone wrong. 										 In these cases we're trying to be as helpful as possible by providing good explanations of what happened.
Whenever we detect that something's not right, you'll see a banner with an error message, letting you know what the problem is.

grapheneos
The private and secure mobile operating system with Android app compatibility. Developed as a non-profit open source project.
Get to know GrapheneOS
GrapheneOS is a privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility developed as a non-profit open source project. It's focused on the research and development of privacy and security technology including substantial improvements to sandboxing, exploit mitigations and the permission model. It was founded in 2014 and was formerly known as CopperheadOS.
GrapheneOS improves the privacy and security of the OS from the bottom up. It deploys technologies to mitigate whole classes of vulnerabilities and make exploiting the most common sources of vulnerabilities substantially more difficult. It improves the security of both the OS and the apps running on it. The app sandbox and other security boundaries are fortified. GrapheneOS tries to avoid impacting the user experience with the privacy and security features. Ideally, the features can be designed so that they're always enabled with no impact on the user experience and no additional complexity like configuration options. It's not always feasible, and GrapheneOS does add various toggles for features like the Network permission, Sensors permission, restrictions when the device is locked (USB peripherals, camera, quick tiles), etc. along with more complex user-facing privacy and security features with their own UX.
The features page provides an overview of the substantial privacy and security improvements added by GrapheneOS to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Many of our past features were contributed to AOSP, Linux and other projects to improve privacy and security for billions of users so they're no longer listed on our features page.
Official releases are available on the releases page and installation instructions are on the install page.
GrapheneOS also develops various apps and services with a focus on privacy and security. Vanadium is a hardened variant of the Chromium browser and WebView specifically built for GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS also includes our minimal security-focused PDF Viewer, our hardware-based Auditor app / attestation service providing local and remote verification of devices, our modern privacy / security focused camera app, and the externally developed Seedvault encrypted backup which was initially developed for inclusion in GrapheneOS.
GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another implementation of Google services like microG. It's possible to install Play services as a set of fully sandboxed apps without special privileges via our sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer. See the FAQ section for more details on our plans for filling in the gaps from not shipping Play services and Google apps.
See the FAQ section on device support.

hackint
hackint is a communication network for the hacker community, but anyone is welcome to use its services. We are fully ircv3.1 and partially ircv3.2 compliant.
tl;dr: Join rooms on hackint.org from Matrix via #channel:hackint.org. Say hello from Matrix in #hackint:hackint.org (for #hackint)!
Back in 2018 we did announce the sunsetting of the matrix bridge. Back then our primary points of concern were:
In the last couple of years we've tested the bridge in multiple rounds in regards to these issues. Over the course of that time the bridge Matrix ecosystem and the bridge code has improved a lot. Especially on the Matrix side there have been huge improvements in terms of memory and cpu consumption as well as retention policies. We'd like to take the time to address each of these points and why we think that we are now able to provide a bridging setup again.
On memory intensiveness: Earlier this year the Synapse team put a lot of effort into reducing the memory consumption of Synapse. The requirements to join large channels has since dropped significantly and we haven't seen a lof of memory (or CPU) usage on regular (fairly busy) homeservers. That being said, the matrix bridge is likely the single most busy server that hackint operates. :)
On logging & database growth: Around the time of our sunsetting the Matrix team started the discussion on message retention (MSC1763). Since then synapse gained support for purging messages based on configurable schedules. We will purge messages (and media) rather agressively and not store it for extended periods of time. This means that we will only backfill history to users that were joined within an hour of a conversation happening, and even that is conditional on a channels privacy settings. This should cover most network segmentations while keeping the data on our servers limited. A note on media: Even if media has already been purged from our services it can (and will) be retrieved from the origin server again when requested.
Last but not least the actual IRC bridge problems: The IRC bridge hasn't seen much love for the last couple of years until the Freenode accident happened. The Matrix team was very eager to provide Matrix bridging to Freenode's spiritual successor Libera.Chat and they started discussing their concerns! This has led to fixes for most of our long-standing gripes with the bridge. You can read more about this in This Week in Matrix 2021-06-18 matrix-appservice-irc notes and the related GitHub issues, conversations etc..
Do we think it is perfect? We wouldn't say so. It is a long way away. You will certainly see issues but the overall experience isn't as rocky as it used to be. This is why we feel confident enough to offer the bridge again.
Heads up! We're going TLS1.3 during this month. The first machine has already been upgraded today and everything looks good.

						Always make sure you are navigating on the real Premium Cards website by checking the onion address : hbl6udan73w7qbjdey6chsu5gq5ehrfqbb73jq726kj3khnev2yarlid.onion. There are a few clones of our website having similar names and design.
					

					The ,,Premium Cards'' business was founded by a group of professional carders who wanted to deliver a product which is 100% SAFE to use by anyone regardless of whether you are a first-time customer or a seasoned ,,professional card casher'' like we like to call our loyal customers. We were among the first to develop what is called a Prepaid Debit card which is basically what it sounds, a pre-paid debit card pre-loaded with funds which have been cleaned multiple times to ensure that no one will ever know the source of the funds and protect our customers from any risk as opposed to a cloned card which are risk associated products because the previous owner can let the bank know something is wrong the first time you try to cashout. Our cards are a simple and stress-free method to increase your wealth.In order to provide a truly complete service, to deliver quickly and shorten the delivery distance thus decreasing even more transit risks we are shipping from multiple locations from the US and Europe.


					All our cards are chipped and magnetic. Contactless is available by request.
				

					PIN number is provided for each card and it is customizable at any ATM featuring this option.
				

					We use latest methods and technologies to provide maximum satisfaction and protection.
				

					Each product comes with a 90 days warranty. You can choose between a new product or a full refund at any point you consider the card is not working as expected or advertised.
				

					Another way of making sure our cards won't attract any unwanted attention while in transit is by printing them to look like a specific gift/prepaid card and by embossing a name, card numbers,etc on them. We can print almost any card design including regular bank cards and embosse any name you need. If you have no idea what design or name to choose, we can make that choice for you or we can leave it blank if that's what you want.


					Click on the images below to see some examples of designs we can print. If none of those examples suit you, e-mail us a picture of the design you wish and we will make it happen.


							Our products have ZERO risks due to our hard work and pioneering methonds of cleaning the funds loaded onto our cards.
						

							Our work never stops. We are a small team but your endorsement motivates us working non stop towards updating our products and methods and that reflects in the number of recurring customers and regular referrals.
						

							We have been here since 2012 which proves we leave no room for mistakes and no room for security concerns.
						

									Over 20.000 clients have been served. So far, there have been no reports of cards not working; for confirmation, see our feedback section.
								

									Our small yet dedicated department in continuously looking for the best techniques to safely deliver from our warehouse to your door or post office box and we haven't disappointed a single one of you.
								

									Our costs reflect our high quality and meticulous work.If product quality and security is what you are looking for then we are glad to take you onboard as a loyal customer.
								

					Years of work and experimenting different methods have finally delivered in 2012, so we can happily present a risk-free card. Currently we can offer you 6 different types of cards with 2 levels of balances each. Inspect and choose the best card that suits you.No matter what card type you decide to purchase, the balance of the card will convert to your local currency at the ATM for a small fee from the bank that runs that specific ATM.


					We are happy to add a new feature, we're now offering our customers the possibility to purchase a card and have it remotely re-loaded for the same cost saving you the trouble of waiting for a new physical card to arrive (the reloadable option costs 30 extra usd at the time you purchase a card).

									You can use any e-mail provider but we would advise to use firstly use TOR browser when purchasing our products and secondly using a safe e-mail service such as : Protonmail, Mail2tor, Ctemplar etc.


									No, the prices shown on our website are final.
								

									Over the years we've understood that safety is what will keep us in business for a longer period than most of our competitors. Greedy people won't last long in this line of business. We do cashout ourselves a portion of what we produce, we have online and local loyal customers but the safest way we can make money and ,,get rid'' of production excess is to spread it all over the world, which means selling it to you. It's a win-win situation.We also ,,hodl’’ part of the crypto we get from customers,so a part of the profit comes from long term holding.


									It's a simple answer. Because we DELIVER and not fail our customer.
								

									Yes, once you go through the automated ordering process on our website you will reach the ,,delivery method'' section where you will choose ,,digital delivery'' and we will e-mail you the full card details within 1 hour.
								

									That is correct.
								

									All confirmed orders will receive a full PDF guide via e-mail with tips and tricks on the diverse ways to cashout perfectly under the radar.

hcaptcha
If you are an accessibility user, please sign up here
hCaptcha is designed to stop bots by distinguishing them from people. Visual tests are a convenient tool for this, but not everyone can solve a visual challenge.
For this reason we have designed simple, painless alternatives to let online services using hCaptcha preserve accessibility for all with full Section 508Â and WCAGÂ 2.1 AAÂ compliance.
We offer two methods of accommodation that accessibility users may encounter.
The first is a purely text-based alternative humanity verification challenge that some services may choose to enable, which is available by choosing the "Text Challenge" option in the hCaptcha widget menu when enabled on a given website or app.
The second is a universal accessibility authorization option that is available on all services using hCaptcha by default. It is designed to be much more accessible than legacy audio challenges, serving not just people with visual impairments but also those with auditory processing issues or other needs for accommodation that neither visual nor auditory challenges can address.
How it works: first, an accessibility user signs up via the accessibility signup page, which is prominently linked in the hCaptcha widget info page. They are given an encrypted cookie that can be used several times per day, but must be refreshed periodically via login.When a challenge is presented to an accessibility user on a site using the hCaptcha service, they will automatically pass or receive an accessible text challenge, depending on the site's settings and other factors. Support for accessibility users is also available via email: [email protected]â
Accessibility user screen after login
Q:Â Is Â hCaptcha Section 508 +Â WCAGÂ 2.1 AA compliant?A:Â We believe so:Â all users with any form of impairment who are able to browse the web and enter text on forms can access services protected by hCaptcha upon registration. However, this is not legal advice: you should perform your own evaluation, taking into consideration your particular implementation to ensure this is the case for your deployment.
Q:Â What is hCaptcha's role in providing accessibility accommodations?A:Â hCaptcha offers a wide variety of security services with many configuration options. These include completely passive security options like hCaptcha Enterprise Passive mode, and several types of humanity verification challenges that offer strong security with a variety of accessibility tradeoffs. The online service using hCaptcha is responsible for deciding whether the provided accessibility options meet its needs, or whether it prefers to combine strong security measures from hCaptcha with alternative accessibility options or procedures for accommodation.
Q:Â How are text-based challenges impacted by large language modelsÂ ("LLMs")?A:Â hCaptcha has worked for years on generative AI use and abuse, including LLMÂ detection. We have integrated a variety of defenses into the hCaptcha Enterprise product suite with LLMs in mind.
Q:Â Are you working on other accessibility ("a11y") options, like audio?Â A:Â Previously popular options like audio captchas discriminate against many a11y users and are easily defeated by modern machine learning techniques. This has forced current audio challenges to become more and more difficult, introducing noise, odd timing, unusual word combinations, and so on to defeat attackers. We are thus less enthusiastic about this approach vs. avoiding the challenge altogether, but will consider it if there is demand from the a11y community.However, we are very interested in Privacy Pass for the Accessibility use case. We believe combining our current a11y approach with Privacy Pass issuance will allow a11y users to browse safely, secure in the knowledge that their traffic is more private, while restricting the abuse by bot operators that inevitably occurs when a11y options are available. We are active participants in the IETF working group standardizing this new technology.
Q:Â What about privacy? Does registration expose a11y browsing data in some way? What do you do with the email?A:Â hCaptcha is designed for privacy from the ground up. It is very different than traditional options like reCAPTCHAÂ that are owned by ad networks, who have an incentive to track you around the web and associate you with a real identity. We never use accessibility emails or info for any purpose other than facilitating a11y use and preventing abuse. Our privacy policy has comprehensive and authoritative answers as to how we use data, but the short answer is we have no interest in associating you as a person with your browsing history.We are also currently working on a cryptographic solution to rapidly discard your email address while still preserving our ability to prevent abuse, complementing our Privacy Pass work.
Q:Â I'm still seeing a challenge after setting the cookie. What's causing this?A:Â This is typically due to using an aggressive ad blocker or anti-cookie extension, or a setting that blocks "cross-site" cookies, in this case a cookie for hcaptcha.com that is set or checked by the hCaptcha JS on a different site, like the one you are visiting. hCaptcha accessibility cookies work with all popular browsers and ad blockers with their standard settings, so typically failures are due to "anti-anti-adblock" scripts or similar rulesets targeting particular sites.Solutions:1. Whitelist hcaptcha.com and *.hcaptcha.com cookies in your ad blocker or browser security extension.2. If you are using the Brave browser, which does not (as of April 2020) appear to have any kind of cookie whitelist, go to Preferences ->Â Shields -> Cookies and choose "Allow All Cookies."3. If you are using the very latest version of Safari on either the recently released OSÂ XÂ 10.15 or iOS 13.4, Apple has just changed the behavior of Safari related to third-party cookies, blocking all of them by default. We are implementing a solution, but in the meantime please visit Safari Preferences, Privacy section, and uncheck "Website tracking: Prevent cross-site tracking" to enable the accessibility cookie to function as expected.Q:Â I use multiple devices. Do I need to sign up multiple times?A:Â No. Please click the same email login link sent to you on each device you use in order to set the cookie.Q:Â How can IÂ protect myself from third-party cookie tracking while using the accessibility cookie?A:Â Using any privacy or ad-blocking extension that supports domain-level whitelisting (e.g. uBlock Origin) will work as expected: just make sure to whitelist hcaptcha.com.

HENSOLDT is a German champion in the defence industry with a leading position in Europe and a global reach. We develop innovative and customer-specific solutions in the fields of radar, electronic warfare, avionics, and optronics. As technology leader, we expand our portfolio continuously to combat a wide range of threats.
HENSOLDT is at the forefront of operational support system development, and currently delivers the OPTARION support capability to the German armed forces for use on its heavy-lift, medium transport and attack helicopter fleets. The company is soon to begin field trials of an upgrade to this planning system, which will future-proof this capability for the German government for many years to come.

The company is soon to begin field trials of an upgrade to this planning system, which will future-proof this capability for the German government for many years to come.
Recent conflicts have highlighted the significant dangers that armed forces face. Soldiers must contend with traditional threats, such as artillery barrages, as well as new technology and tactics in the form of deadly drone attacks. In this new 21st century theatre of conflict, personnel have quickly learned that early detection of threats and mobility are key to survival. LetÂ´s learn how HENSOLDT can help.
Through its acquisition of Kelvin Hughes, HENSOLDT can boast a UK pedigree stretching back over a century, and has firmly established itself as a key supplier to the UK Ministry of Defence. The established relationship with the UK government has positioned the company well to provide best-in-class solutions and HENSOLDT has ambitious growth plans in the UK to solidify this footprint further.
The European Space Agencyâs latest space exploration mission, known as the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer â or JUICE â promises to unlock many more secrets of our solar system, including whether there is potential for extra-terrestrial life beyond earth. With the help of key instrumentation from HENSOLDT, the ESA JUICE mission will give unprecedented insights into Jupiter and what lies beneath the surface of its moons.
As Russia continues its aggressive actions and the threat of state-on-state conflict heightens, the ability for NATO aircraft to freely operate within congested and contested airspace will become increasingly challenging for the Alliance. In this context, electronic attack becomes essential for military airborne operations. HENSOLDT is leading the development of a new escort jammer that will enhance crew protection and freedom of manoeuvre.
After its successful launch in December 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope began beaming back incredible imagery of our universe. In this story, we discover more about how HENSOLDTÂ´s key role in James Webb and how this experience is shaping future space-borne solutions.
Advanced sensor solutions for military platforms is what HENSOLDT effectively delivers to its customers every day, contributing to strengthen national security. But as overall corporate responsibility is integral to success, our contribution to live in a secure world is much higher. More insights about our efforts to make the difference for a safer tomorrow in the interview with HENSOLDT CStO Celia Pelaz.
The invasion of Ukraine meant the end of the European post-war order and heralds a turning point in security policy for all European countries. As the tragedy of war touches HENSOLDT as a company but also our employees on an individual level, we started to help the Ukranian people in different ways, both military and civil.
HENSOLDTâs Multifunctional Self Protection System (MUSS) has provided protection to frontline vehicle crews for several years now, and remains one of the only mature and proven soft-kill systems available on the market. But HENSOLDT is not standing still and is advancing with plans that will see MUSS optimised even further: Welcome to MUSS 2.0.
The ability to avoid collisions with other aircraft is one of the most mission-critical requirements for the full integration of unmanned aircraft into the airspace to support both military and civil applications. That is why HENSOLDT is putting a lot of effort into a detection and avoidance system with radar at its heart. In this article we look at the latest developments.
Semiconductors integrated circuits are fundamental building blocks of any modern electronical device â and HENSOLDTâs Final Focus Metrology (FFM) system assists with their production. In our brand new story, we taka a further look into our role as leading supplier of beam metrology solutions for the production control of semiconductor photolithography systems.
We are surrounded by a wealth of information, and the ability to collect open-source data from multiple sources and turn it into useful intelligence is vital for many sectors. HENSOLDT Analytics is at the forefront of developing market-leading OSINT solutions for its customers, and continues to invest in this disruptive capability.
For the first time, HENSOLDT is leading the development of a new Eurofighter radar. To be implemented in the middle of the decade, this future radar answers new operational requirements by adding considerable capability to the first iteration of Typhoon E-scan radar. A status report. 
Todayâs maritime vessels have to be equipped with a range of sensors to ensure they meet the strict regulations, especially when it comes to safety. Traditionally, these systems are disconnected and create information overload for personnel. HENSOLDT has addressed this challenge and developed the Integrated Bridge System Manta NEO, providing the latest generation bridge system with fusion technologies as standard.
Ground combat has changed significantly over the last decade. Conflicts are now more likely to be fought in urban environments â where movement and visibility is difficult for armoured vehicles. In this environment, how can we make vehicle crews safer?
Smaller ships like offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) are often limited in space, reducing the number of sensors that can be installed. To boost OPV capabilities, HENSOLDT has pioneered a combined radar and IFF solution, optimizing the limited mast space available on-board. 
Gone are the days when each platform operated within its own ecosystem and delivered information retrospectively. Operators now expect a complete situational awareness picture with a live view of their surroundings. Thus, sensor fusion technologies will shape a new kind of battlefield. 
Modern surveillance aircraft â whether manned or unmanned â are bristling with an array of sensors and high-performance systems. These enable the crews on board to carry out complex missions against a wide spectrum of threats. Thus, the seamless integration of multiple onboard systems is now more important than ever before. As a one-stop-shop for all these technologies, HENSOLDT follows an innovative systems approach to airborne ISR. 
People are the backbone of everything we do at HENSOLDT. We want to unlock the potential in each and every employee to bring out the best for both them and the company, but only when everybody is given the same opportunities and is on a level footing can this truly be a reality.
As onboard systems in aviation become increasingly networked, the additional threat of malicious cyber-attacks is rising significantly.
Powerful ISR radars were often limited to larger aircraft. With PrecISR, HENSOLDT sets a new baseline for what is possible with airborne sensors.
As proven partner of the German and French armed forces, HENSOLDT strives to develop the game-changing networked sensor solution for MGCS.
Digital sensors are vital for todayâs security and military forces enabling situational awareness and threat detection at greater ranges, even in low visibility conditions such as bad weather or at night. HENSOLDTâs experts advance these sensor technologies and leverage areas such as artificial intelligence and deep-learning algorithms to stay ahead of the game.
Sensors are powerful by themselves, but we have boosted their effectiveness even further by developing advanced command and control (C2) solutions that fuse multiple sensors together. We will explore what this means for todayâs security forces.
The future is bright for unmanned aviation and the opportunities that this technology will bring for both civil and military operators. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be tackled in order to realise its full potential.
The combat aircraft Eurofighter Typhoon is considered the backbone of many air forces in Europe and the Middle East. In order to provide longevity and to ensure that the Typhoon aircraft will continue to be a force multiplier, the fighter is receiving capability upgrades, including the introduction of a new radar system.
A key component of the EUâs European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) command and control modernisation project is the European Train Control System (ETCS), the signalling and control element that serves to provide commonality across national railways, replacing legacy systems currently in operation. 
In many technology companies, women are still rather the exception in production facilities. Not so at HENSOLDT: in the Microwave Factory in Ulm, the proportion of women has almost reached the 50 percent mark now.
IFF Mode 5 is a prerequisite for joint military missions of NATO and non-NATO nations. All IFF identification systems using the new Mode 5 standard must be certified by the US DoD AIMS Program Office or NATO nations to receive necessary encryption keys. HENSOLDT Services supports armed forces worldwide to gain the necessary certification.
Armoured vehicles have always had one big advantage â they protect their crew. However, this has so far been accompanied  by a decisive disadvantage: the crew can only have a  very limited view of their surroundings. HENSOLDT has solved this problem.
Whether autonomous air taxis, parcel delivery from the air, surveillance  or interception drones â numerous development projects are  currently under way for the  unmanned future of flying.  Leading the way: HENSOLDTâs subsidiary EUROAVIONICS with its autopilots.
HENSOLDTâs Xpeller counter-UAV system provides protection from the ever-increasing threat posed by over-the-counter drones, both in the military and the civil sector.
With our new Twinvis passive radar, HENSOLDT has revolutionised classical radar technology. This system does not emit any signals itself, which means that it remains virtually invisible. Nevertheless it can even locate aircraft equipped with stealth technology.

En Europa, Toyota ofrece una extensa gama de SUV hÃ­bridos que son muy bien aceptados por los compradores Â en sus respectivos segmento.. El Yaris Cross, el Corolla Cross, el CH-R, el RAV4 y el Highlander son considerados los referentes a vencer por otras marcas. A pesar de esta oferta, es importante destacar que Toyota selecciona especÃ­ficamente estos modelos para el mercado europeo, incluyendo el espaÃ±ol. Sin embargo, esto no significa que la marca no fabrique otros modelos que considera mÃ¡s adecuados para otros paÃ­ses.
Es el caso del Toyota Venza, un SUV hÃ­bridoÂ a la venta en Estados Unidos con este nombre y que se llama Harrier en JapÃ³n. Un coche que milita en el mismo segmento que el RAV4, pero que ofrece otras cualidades, entre ellas un aspecto algo mÃ¡s refinado, un poco al estilo Lexus, la marca prÃ©mium de la casa.
La primera generaciÃ³n del Toyota Venza se diseÃ±Ã³ principalmente para satisfacer las demandas del mercado estadounidense, lo que se refleja en su estilo elegante y sencillo. Sin embargo, con la llegada del modelo de segunda generaciÃ³n, en 2020, Toyota ampliÃ³ su estrategia comercial para abarcar los mercados internacionales, trasladando la producciÃ³n a JapÃ³n.
Sin apenas cambios, el Venza de 2020 ha pasado a convertirse en el Venza 2024, aunque es idÃ©ntico al que llevaÂ cuatro aÃ±os en producciÃ³n. Su gama abarca varias versiones: LE, XLE, Nightshade Edition y Limited. Mide 4.740 mm de largo, 1.854 mm de ancho y 1.674 mm de alto, con una distancia entre ejes de 2.690 mm. El maletero es gigante con un volumen de 815 litros.
Su diseÃ±o no ha pasado de moda, a pesar de tener cuatro aÃ±os a sus espaldas. La parte delantera es uno de sus rasgos distintivos por su sencillez y tambiÃ©n porque ha soportado muy bien el paso del tiempo. Sus faros LED estrechos y pequeÃ±os ayudan a detenerÂ el reloj.
Su silueta presenta un techo alto que no cae de manera precipitada limitando la visiÃ³n trasera. Las llantas de 19 pulgadas ayudan a dar un carÃ¡cter deportivo a su perfil. En la parte trasera, la franja de luces LED que une los pilotos crea este mismo efecto de diseÃ±o.
Por dentro, el equipamiento y el diseÃ±o del salpicadero nada tienen que envidiar a los modelos mÃ¡s actuales de la marca. Todas las configuraciones del Toyota Venza incluyen el sistema Toyota Audio Multimedia integrado en la pantalla flotante de infoentretenimiento situada en el centro del salpicadero.
En la versiÃ³n bÃ¡sica LEÂ es de 8 pulgadas y cuenta con reconocimiento de voz, Bluetooth, Android Auto inalÃ¡mbrico, Apple CarPlay inalÃ¡mbrico, Amazon Alexa y compatibilidad con Sirius XM.
El resto de versiones estÃ¡n equipadas con una pantalla de 12,3 pulgadas, la misma que se encuentra en modelos como el Highlander, bZ4X y vehÃ­culos de Lexus como el NX y RZ.
El Venza estÃ¡ basado en la Nueva Arquitectura Global K de Toyota (TNGA-K) que monta exclusivamente el Toyota Hybrid System II (THS II). Cuenta con un motor de inyecciÃ³n directa de 2,5 litros y tres motores elÃ©ctricos: dos en la parte delantera y uno en la parte trasera.
La transmisiÃ³n variable continua (CVT) controlada electrÃ³nicamente proporciona tracciÃ³n a las ruedas delanteras, mientras que las traseras reciben potencia de cada uno de los motores dedicados. Este sistema hÃ­brido genera una potencia total de 219 CV.
Ofrece cuatro modos de conducciÃ³n: Normal, Eco, Sport y EV. El modo Normal es ideal para la conducciÃ³n cotidiana, alternando entre el motor elÃ©ctrico y el de combustiÃ³n del Toyota Hybrid System II (THS II). El modo Eco prioriza la eficiencia de combustible, mientras que el modo Sport optimiza el rendimiento del vehÃ­culo. Por otro lado, el modo EV permite conducir exclusivamente con energÃ­a elÃ©ctrica, utilizando la baterÃ­a de iones de litio de 0,9 kWh, hasta agotar su capacidad.
En cuanto a los sistemas de seguridad, viene equipado de serie con Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ (TSS 2.5+) que incluye seis funciones activas de seguridad y asistencia al conductor que utilizan una cÃ¡mara de alta resoluciÃ³n y un radar de ondas milimÃ©tricas.
Entre las caracterÃ­sticas de TSS 2.5+ se encuentran el sistema precolisiÃ³n con detecciÃ³n de peatones (PCS con PD), el control de crucero con radar dinÃ¡mico de velocidad completa (DRCC), la alerta de cambio de carril con asistencia de direcciÃ³n (LDA con SA), la asistencia de seguimiento de carril (LTA), las luces altas automÃ¡ticas (AHB) y el asistente de seÃ±ales de trÃ¡fico (RSA).

              CIA Renditions to Jordan
            

                          Note written by Ali al-Hajj al-Sharqawi while he was in secret detention at GID headquarters in Wadi Sir.

                                      Â© 2008 Human Rights Watch
                      
"Why Jordan?"
The question puzzled Abu Hamza al-Tabuki, a Saudi citizen who claims that US
agents arrested him in Afghanistan in December 2001, interrogated him in
Pakistan, and then flew him in a private jet to Jordan.Â  Because he was not Jordanian and had no past
connection to Jordan,
he did not understand why he was sent there.Â 
"Why wasn't I sent to America
since I was arrested by Americans?" al-Tabuki asked, in a narrative he sent to
contacts in Jordan
after he was released.
What al-Tabuki learned was that Jordan
offered greater possibilities for abusive interrogations: it was a place for
him to be questioned "more freely," as one US official put it. 
According to al-Tabuki, the Jordanians' methods included
"terror and fear, torture and beatings, insults and verbal abuse, and threats
to expose my private parts and rape me."Â 
Nor was al-Tabuki alone in facing this abuse.Â  Based on our investigations in Jordan and
elsewhere, including interviews with several former detainees, Human Rights
Watch has concluded that al-Tabuki was one of at least 14 prisoners that the
United States sent to Jordan for interrogation and likely torture.
From 2001 until at least 2004, Jordan's General Intelligence
Department (GID) served as a proxy jailer for the US Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), holding prisoners that the CIA apparently wanted kept out of
circulation, and later handing some of them back to the CIA.Â  More than just warehousing these men, the GID
interrogated them using methods that were even more brutal than those in which
the CIA has been implicated to date.Â  The
prisoners were typically held for several months in GID custody-and in at least
one case, for nearly two years.
While the exact number of transfers cannot be ascertained,
Human Rights Watch has found that at least 14 non-Jordanian prisoners were sent
from United States
to Jordanian custody during this three-year period, and the actual figure may
be much higher.Â  While a few other
countries have received individuals rendered by the United
 States in recent years (that is, transferred without
formal legal process), no country is known to have detained as many as Jordan.
Human Rights Watch has credible information indicating that
the prisoners included at least five Yemenis, three Algerians,two Saudis,
a Mauritanian, a Syrian, a Tunisian, and one or more Chechens.Â  They may also have included a Libyan, an
Iraqi Kurd, a Kuwaiti, one or more Egyptians, and a national of the United Arab Emirates.
The majority of the men whom the US
brought to Jordan were
initially arrested in either of two places: in Pakistan,
particularly the city of Karachi, and in Georgia,
from the Pankisi Gorge. One reportedly said that he was held for three months
at a US prison in Iraq before being moved to Jordan, while many others were later held in
secret CIA detention in Kabul or at the US military base at Bagram, in Afghanistan.
These prisoners include five men currently held at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba-Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Hassan bin Attash, Ali al-Hajj
al-Sharqawi, Jamal Mar'i, and Mohamedou Ould Slahi-as well as one man believed
to be in custody in Saudi Arabia.Â  Ibn
al-Sheikh al-Libi, currently in custody in Libya,
was probably also held in Jordan
for a time.Â  The current whereabouts of a
number of other former prisoners are unknown or unconfirmed, though some of
them may have been returned to their countries of origin.
While in GID detention in late 2002, one of these prisoners,
Ali al-Hajj al-Sharqawi, wrote a long note describing his ordeal.Â  The note, which al-Sharqawi marked with his
thumb print, was smuggled out of the facility in 2003.Â  In it, al-Sharqawi describes being held as a
secret prisoner and hidden in secret cells.Â 
Consistent with what al-Sharqawi told two fellow prisoners at GID at the
time, the note states that the GID interrogators "beat me in a way that does
not know any limits."
"They threatened me with electricity," the note continues,
"with snakes and dogs .... [They said] we'll make you see death .... They
threatened to rape me."
Al-Sharqawi later told his lawyers at Guantanamo that GID interrogators had
subjected him to a torture method known as falaqa,
by which prisoners are given extended beatings on the bottoms of their
feet.Â  He said that after the
interrogators beat him, they would resume interrogating him, and would threaten
to electrocute him if he did not provide information.Â  He also told his lawyers that when
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited
the GID facility, he was hidden from them.
The same two prisoners who communicated with al-Sharqawi
while he was held at GID also communicated with Hassan bin Attash.Â  They said that bin Attash arrived at the GID
facility several months after al-Sharqawi, and suffered similarly abusive
treatment.Â  
"Just about everyone at GID was beaten with sticks," one
former GID prisoner told Human Rights Watch. "People were beaten on their
feet.Â  They did it in the basement.Â  I was beaten twice, but al-Sharqawi, ba
Attash and al-Jeddawi [a Saudi prisoner who was rendered to Jordan] were beaten much more than
me."
According to another former detainee who claims that he was
held in a neighboring cell, terrorist suspect Ramzi bin al-Shibh was among the
prisoners that US agents transferred to GID custody.Â  The former detainee told Human Rights Watch that al-Shibh (who was arrested
in Pakistan
in September 2002) was held in GID custody in late 2002.Â  Al-Shibh reportedly said that he had been
flown to Jordan via Qatar,
and that he had been badly tortured in Jordanian custody.
Flight records that Human Rights
 Watch has obtained support these claims.Â  Civilian aircraft linked to the CIA,
including Gulfstream jets and Boeing 737s that are known to have been used for
prisoner transport, made dozens of trips to Jordan during the period of 2001 to
2004.Â  Some of these flights coincide
exactly with the dates that detainees said they were transferred.
In a meeting with Human Rights Watch in Amman
in late August 2007, senior GID officials categorically denied that the GID had
held prisoners rendered by the United
  States.Â 
They also denied that torture was practiced in GID detention.Â  Given the weight of credible evidence showing
the opposite, their denials are unconvincing.
Human Rights Watch
conducted research for this report from August 2007 to February 2008 in Jordan.
We held in depth interviews with six Jordanian nationals who said that while
they were detained at the GID detention facility in Amman, they communicated with prisoners who
had been delivered to the GID from US custody.[1]Â  All of our informants were detained by the
GID for varying periods of time between mid-2002 and 2005.Â  Human Rights Watch
also spoke to a former Guantanamo detainee who
said that while at Guantanamo he spoke to
prisoners who had been rendered by the CIA to Jordan.Â  In addition, we received extremely useful
information from lawyers representing detainees at Guantanamo,
including detainees who were previously held for a time in Jordan.Â  Finally, Human
 Rights Watch interviewed more than a dozen Jordanians who
claim that they were brutally tortured in GID custody during this same period,
and who described the torture techniques that the GID employed.Â  We have sought, wherever possible, to
corroborate information from interviews with prisoners' written accounts,
flight logs, and other secondary materials.

The US
practice of rendering terrorist suspects abroad-in other words, of transferring
prisoners to foreign custody outside of normal legal proceedings-predates the
September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.Â  During the administration of President Bill
Clinton, the CIA rendered a number of Egyptian terrorist suspects from
countries such as Albania
and Croatia to Egypt,
where some of them had previously been sentenced to death in absentia.[2]
After September 2001, however, the CIA's rendition practices changed.Â  Rather than returning people to their home
countries to face "justice" (albeit justice that included torture and grossly
unfair trials), the CIA began handing people over to third countries apparently
to facilitate abusive interrogations.
The US
may have had several reasons for transferring suspects to Jordan for detention and
interrogation. The CIA already had a history of close relations with the
Jordanian intelligence agency; there was apparently a shortage of Arabic
speakers on CIA staff, and CIA officials may have believed that Jordanian
officials were particularly well versed in counterterrorism or perhaps would be
particularly good at keeping the fact of the detentions secret. Yet Jordan
was already notorious for torturing security detainees, and this would have
been well known to US officials at the time of the transfers. As detailed in
this report, many of the detainees were returned to CIA custody immediately
after intensive periods of abusive interrogation in Jordan, and certain US
officials, including former CIA officer Michael Scheuer, have made statements
suggesting that detainees were knowingly sent to a place where they would be
abused. The evidence indicates that torture in such cases was not a regrettable
consequence of rendition; it may have been the purpose.
In a classified briefing for US senators not long after the
September 11 attacks, then-CIA Director George Tenet reportedly alluded to the
thinking behind these new renditions.Â 
Asked whether the US
government was planning to seek the transfer of Al Qaeda suspects from abusive
governments, Tenet suggested that it might be preferable for some suspects to
remain in the hands of foreign authorities able to use more aggressive
interrogation methods on them.[3]Â  Cofer Black, who served as the Director of
the CIA's CounterterroristCenter from 1999 until
May 2002, put the matter more bluntly.Â 
In discussing the detention of "nearly three thousand al-Qa'ida terrorists
and their supporters," he said that "there was a before 9/11 and there was an
after 9/11.Â  After 9/11 the gloves come
off."[4]
Just after the September 11 attacks, US President George W. Bush signed
a classified presidential directive giving the CIA expanded authority to
arrest, interrogate, detain, and render terrorist suspects arrested abroad.[5]Â  Since that time, the US is believed to have rendered terrorism
suspects to the custody of Egypt,
Morocco, Libya, and Syria,
in addition to Jordan.Â  But the available evidence suggests that Jordan was the first country to receive rendered
detainees after September 11, and that Jordan accepted the largest number
of detainees.[6]
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, under pressure from
European allies because of press revelations about CIA activities in Europe, offered a vigorous defense of US rendition
practices in December 2005.Â  Asserting
that the practice of rendition was a "vital tool in combating transnational
terrorism," Rice claimed that the United States and other countries
have long relied on renditions to transport terrorist suspects from the country
where they were arrested to their home country or to other countries where they
can be held and questioned.Â  She insisted,
moreover, that the United
  States "does not transport, and has not
transported, detainees from one country to another for the purpose of
interrogation using torture."Â  Instead,
she explained that, where necessary, "the United States seeks assurances that
transferred persons will not be tortured."[7]
The systematic nature of the abuses suffered by prisoners
rendered to Jordan
contradicts Rice's bland reassurances.Â 
If the Jordanians did indeed promise the US
authorities that prisoners rendered there would not be tortured, it was a
promise that neither the US
nor Jordan
believed.
A description of the rendition process provided by
then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in August 2006 was somewhat more
revealing.Â  Testifying before the Senate
Armed Services Committee, Gonzales explained that "we seek assurances, whenever
we transfer someone, that in fact that they will not be tortured." He admitted,
however, that: "you know, we are not there-(chuckles)-in the jail cell in
foreign countries where we render someone."[8]
Michael Scheuer, a former CIA officer who claims to have
initiated the terrorist rendition program during the Clinton administration,
rightly dismisses these assurances as "legal niceties"-pledges meant to look
good on paper, which provide no real protection. He has said that both CIA agents
and their superiors were aware that abuses were likely.
As Scheuer has explained: 
The growing weight of evidence and international expert
opinion indicates that diplomatic assurances cannot protect people at risk of
torture on return.[10]Â  Part of what makes such promises ineffective
is the nature of torture, which is practiced in secret, using techniques that
may not leave marks and may defy detection (for example, mock drowning, sexual
assault, and threats of violence). And detainees subjected to torture are often
afraid to complain to anyone about the abuse for fear of reprisals against them
or their family members.
It is unknown precisely how many people have been rendered
to foreign custody since 2001.Â 
Representative Ed Markey, a member of the Select Committee on Homeland
Security, told the New Yorker in 2005 that he had been unable to obtain a
count. "I've asked people at the CIA for numbers," he said. "They refuse
to answer. All they will say is that they're in compliance with the law."[11]Â  CIA Director Michael Hayden claimed in a
September 7, 2007, speech before the Council on Foreign Relations that fewer
than 100 people had been rendered abroad since the September 11 attacks:
"mid-range two figures," in his words.[12]
Jordan's
General Intelligence Department (GID) (Da'irat al-Mukhabarat al-'Amma) is the
country's main intelligence agency, charged with investigating threats to
national security.[13]Â  TTThe
GID has long had a close and cooperative working relationship with the CIA.[14]Â  That relationship deepened further still in
the wake of the September 11 attacks.[15]Â  Given the intimate nature of GID/CIA links,
it is hardly surprising that the CIA turned to the GID when President Bush gave
the agency expanded authority to detain and question people suspected of links
to terrorism.
The GID's abusive interrogation practices are well
known.Â  Numerous former GID prisoners
have reported that while in GID custody they were subjected to torture or
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.Â 
In particular, many have claimed that guards brought them to the
basement of the GID detention building in Wadi Sir and administered the falaqa: beating them on the soles of
their feet.[16]Â  Others have said that they were hit, deprived
of sleep, or given pills and injections that induced feelings of extreme
anxiety.
These men's claims are supported by the findings of UN
envoys and international organizations. In 2006, after carrying out a visit to Jordan, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture
issued a report concluding that: "The practice of torture is widespread in Jordan,
and in some places routine, [including] the General Intelligence Directorate
(GID)."Â  Although the Special Rapporteur
was denied access to interview prisoners held in GID detention in Amman, he cited credible
and consistent allegations that torture was used at GID headquarters "to
extract confessions and obtain intelligence in pursuit of counter-terrorism and
national security objectives."[17]
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have reported similar findings.[18]
US
officials were well aware of these abuses, including during 2001 to 2004.Â  The Jordan chapter of the US State
Department's 2001 human rights report states that prisoners in the custody of
Jordanian police and security forces have alleged that "methods of torture
include sleep deprivation, beatings on the soles of the feet, prolonged
suspension with ropes in contorted positions, and extended solitary
confinement."[19]
Prisoners transferred from US to Jordanian custody from 2001
to 2004 were held at the GID's main headquarters in Amman, located in the Jandawil district in
Wadi Sir. The headquarters, which appear to cover nearly an acre of land,
contain a large four-story detention facility that Human Rights Watch visited
in August 2007.[20]
The building that holds the detention facility is in the
shape of two triangles that together form a square; the facility itself takes
up approximately half of the building, i.e., one of the triangles.Â  Each floor of the detention facility, except
the top floor, consists of three main corridors (the sides of the triangle)
running around a central courtyard.Â  The
administrative offices and interrogation rooms are on the second floor of the
building, while visiting rooms are on the ground floor.Â  During the period that Human
 Rights Watch inspected the facility, all of the detainees in
custody were held on the second floor.[21]Â  There are also many cells on the ground floor
and third floor, however, as well as a small number of cells on the fourth
floor, which includes a few collective cells and what the director called the
"women's section" of the facility.[22]Â  In addition, the facility has a basement
where many prisoners have claimed that they were brought for the most violent
treatment.
Prisoners in GID detention at Wadi Sir are kept in
single-person cells and are prohibited from speaking with one another, but some
have managed to communicate via the back window of their cells.Â  (Each cell faces onto the central courtyard,
and has a window looking out on the yard.)
After September 11, 2001, the CIA quickly began rendering
suspected terrorists to Jordan
for interrogation.[23]Â  The first case may have been that of Jamal
Mar'i, a Yemeni living in Karachi,
who was picked up by a joint team of CIA and Pakistani intelligence operatives
at his home on September 23.Â  Within a
few weeks of his arrest, he was delivered to GID custody in Jordan, where he was held for
several months.Â  Mar'i, who is now in
detention at Guantanamo, has not complained of
being tortured in Jordan;
in this respect his case is unusual.
What is typical about Mar'i's case-and what distinguishes it
from pre-September 2001 renditions-is that Mar'i was not Jordanian, and had no
particular connection to Jordan.[24]Â  The GID had no obvious reason to be concerned
about Mar'i, beyond an interest in helping the CIA.Â  It appears, in short, that the GID acted as a
true proxy jailer for the CIA: primarily serving the CIA's interests, rather than
collaborating with the agency for its own security reasons.
The fact that several detainees were later returned to CIA
custody after spending time in Jordan
further suggests that the GID's goal in the rendition program was assisting the
CIA rather than directly furthering Jordanian security objectives.Â  Such people were not actually handed over;
rather they were effectively lent to Jordan for interrogation
purposes.Â  At least five men who are
currently detained at Guantanamo were previously
rendered to Jordan
for some amount of time during the period of 2001 to 2004.Â  In addition, at least two Yemeni prisoners
who were later held in secret CIA prisons (without being sent to Guantanamo)
were arrested in Jordan and held in GID custody for a few days or weeks prior
to their transfer into US custody.[25]
Al-Sharqawi, one of the detainees whom the CIA delivered to Jordan in 2002,
noticed that GID interrogators were extremely eager to provide information to
the CIA.Â  In the note that al-Sharqawi
wrote while in GID detention in 2002, he said: 
He later told his lawyers that one of his Jordanian
interrogators acknowledged that he was asking questions that the Americans had
provided.[27]
Not long after Ma'ri was transferred to Jordan, another Yemeni living in Pakistan
was apparently sent there as well.Â  Jamil
Qasim Saeed Mohammed was a student; he was studying microbiology at KarachiUniversity.Â  After being arrested by the Pakistani
security forces and handed over to US authorities, he was reportedly flown to Jordan
in the early morning hours of October
 24, 2001.Â  Very little is
known about his case, since he has not been seen since that time, but
journalists reported that he was an Al Qaeda operative.[28]
A third person rendered to Jordan in 2001 was Mohamedou Ould
Slahi.Â  Slahi, a Mauritanian citizen, was
arrested in Mauritania in
November 2001, brought to Jordan
soon after, and held there until July 2002.Â 
Like Mar'i and others, he is currently incarcerated at Guantanamo.
Several prisoners were believed to have been rendered by the
US to Jordan in 2002, including Ali al-Hajj al-Sharqawi, Hassan bin Attash,
Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ibrahim Abu Mu'ath al-Jeddawi, Abu Hamza al-Tabuki, Khayr
al-Din al-Jaza'eri, Abu Yousef al-Jaza'eri, Abu Hassan al-Suri, and Abu Bakr
Saddiqi, as well as a number of people whose names are unknown.[29]Â  Although it is difficult to know with
certainty-and additional prisoners reportedly arrived in 2003-it appears that
2002 was the year in which the CIA delivered the largest number of people to Jordan.Â  (This may be because as time went on the CIA
developed its own detention capacity, opening secret facilities in Thailand, Afghanistan,
Poland, and Romania, and had less need to rely on Jordan.[30])Â  Some of the detainees who arrived in Jordan
in 2002 were held for more than a year, leaving GID custody in 2004.Â  While it is impossible to estimate the total
number of people who were rendered to Jordan, some former prisoners told Human Rights Watch that for a while in 2002 and 2003
the third floor of the GID detention facility was "full" of non-Jordanian
prisoners who had been delivered by the CIA.
Pakistan,
and in particular the city of Karachi, was the
source of at least six detainees believed to have been rendered to Jordan from US
custody.Â  The Pakistani authorities have
made no secret of the fact that since September 2001 they have handed over
several hundred terrorism suspects to the United
 States, boasting of the transfers as proof of Pakistan's
cooperation in US counterterrorism efforts.[31]Â  A large number of these men ended up at Guantanamo; some ended up in secret CIA prisons, and
others were rendered to Jordan
and other countries.[32]
Another source of prisoners was the Pankisi Gorge, in Georgia.Â  Home to thousands of Chechen refugees, the
Pankisi Gorge borders on Russia's
Chechnya region and has long served as an entry point for Arab mujahideen
seeking to fight in Chechnya.Â  In early 2002, under US pressure, the Georgian
government began arresting Arabs found there, including a number of Algerians.[33]Â  Some of these men were transferred to proxy
CIA prisons in Afghanistan,
and then sent to Guantanamo,
but others were brought by the CIA elsewhere.Â 
At least four of the men who were reportedly rendered to Jordan in 2002-Khayr
al-Din al-Jaza'eri, Abu Yousef al-Jaza'eri, Abu Hassan al-Suri and Abu Bakr
Saddiqi-were reportedly picked up in Georgia.Â 
(Khayr al-Din al-Jaza'eri, an Algerian, is also described in the court
opinion of a high-profile French terrorism prosecution as a militant who
operated in the Pankisi Gorge.[34])Â  The current whereabouts of all four men are
unknown, although it is likely that they were at some point transferred to
their home countries for continued detention.
Torture and cruel or inhuman treatment seems to have been
systematically used against the detainees rendered by the CIA to Jordan, with
the exception of al-Mar'i.Â  As described
in detail below, detainees claim that they were threatened, beaten, insulted,
deprived of sleep, and subjected to falaqa.Â  In addition, they appear to have been systematically
hidden from the ICRC representatives who visited the GID detention
facility.Â  Human Rights Watch interviewed
several former GID detainees who said that they were hidden whenever the ICRC
visited, and that prisoners rendered to Jordan
by the United States
were hidden as well.
Al-Tabuki, the Saudi who was in GID custody in 2002,
described how he was hidden during the ICRC's visits: 
Similarly, Sharqawi told his lawyers that whenever ICRC
representatives visited the GID facility, he would be moved to the soldiers'
lecture room at 4 a.m. and
kept there until the representatives left. 
The secrecy surrounding the detention of these men
continues.Â  While five people who were
previously rendered to Jordan
are now at Guantanamo, and two are believed to
have been released, the current whereabouts of most of the prisoners whom the US rendered to Jordan is not known.Â  It is quite possible that many or all of the
remaining detainees underwent a second rendition, being transferred from Jordan
back to their home countries without any legal proceedings or any opportunity
to challenge the transfer.
Ibrahim "Abu Mu'ath" al-Jeddawi is a Saudi who reportedly
lived in Yemen.Â  Human Rights Watch spoke to two former
detainees held by the GID who said that they communicated with him while he was
detained at the GID detention facility in late 2002; al-Tabuki wrote that he
saw al-Jeddawi there, too.Â  He was said
to be approximately 32-38 years old.
In early 2002, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
placed Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi (almost certainly the same person) on its "Seeking
Information â War on Terrorism" list, calling him a known associate of a Yemeni
al Qaeda cell leader.[36]Â  A little more than a month later, however,
al-Jeddawi was removed from the list, probably because the FBI learned that he
was in CIA or Jordanian custody.Â  Human
Rights Watch has confirmed that he was transferred to GID custody sometime in
the first half of 2002.[37]
Human Rights Watch's sources differ regarding where
al-Jeddawi was arrested.Â  Both al-Tabuki
and another person claim that al-Jeddawi was arrested in Yemen.Â  Al-Tabuki said that he was arrested less than
a month after his wedding.Â  A third
source, however, who was also held in GID custody with al-Jeddawi, believes
that al-Jeddawi was arrested in Kuwait,
although he was not certain about this point.Â 
All of them agree, at any rate, that al-Jeddawi was in US custody prior to being handed over to Jordan.Â  And according to one source, a US
agent "hit him in the head."
A summary of evidence memo used in annual status review
proceedings for Abdul Rahman Mohammed Khowlan, a Saudi citizen who was held at
Guantanamo from 2002 to 2006, mentions Khowlan's association with someone named
"Abu Mu'ath."[38]Â  This may very well be the same person, and
suggests that the US
military may have relied on information obtained from al-Jeddawi while
al-Jeddawi was in US or Jordanian custody.
One person, who told Human Rights Watch that al-Jeddawi was
"famous in Afghanistan,"
said:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
This same informant not only saw al-Jeddawi in custody in
late 2002 but also communicated with al-Jeddawi's family later. He said that
the family told him that al-Jeddawi was held at the GID facility for more than
a year, during which time he was kept hidden from the ICRC.Â  Al-Jeddawi is believed to be currently
incarcerated in Saudi Arabia.
Khayr al-Din al-Jaza'eri, Abu Yousef al-Jaza'eri, and Abu
Bakr Saddiqi, all Algerians, and Abu Hassan al-Suri, a Syrian, were reportedly
arrested in Georgia in 2002
and rendered by US agents to Jordan.[39]Â  All but Saddiqi were said to have been
arrested together in April 2002; it is not clear when Saddiqi was picked up.
Al-Tabuki mentioned Khayr al-Din al-Jaza'eri in his account,
saying that he was "sent to Jordan
in a private jet to be interrogated by Jordanian intelligence, who sought to
extract from him information about Chechen fighters. And he was threatened to
be falsely tied to a terrorist conspiracy against British interests, since he
was originally a British resident."Â 
Khayr al-Din al-Jaza'eri is also mentioned in the written judgment of a
high-profile French terrorism prosecution, the so-called "Chechen network"
case.[40]
The current whereabouts of all four men are unknown,
although it is possible that they were at some point transferred to their home
countries-i.e., Algeria and Syria-for
continued detention.
Several former prisoners said that one or more Chechens who
had been brought to the GID detention facility by Americans were held there in
2002-2003.Â  One such prisoner, who was
held in GID custody in late 2002, told Human Rights Watch that at least one
Chechen had originally been detained in Georgia. A different former GID
prisoner, who was held in 2003, said that he had seen writing on his cell wall
from a prisoner who wrote that he was from Chechnya.
Abu Hamza al-Tabuki, a Saudi national, was arrested in Karachi, Pakistan,
in late 2001.Â  Two prisoners whom Human
Rights Watch interviewed said that they spoke to him while he was in detention,
and one of them provided Human Rights Watch an account of his stay in GID
detention that al-Tabuki wrote after his release.
In his account, al-Tabuki explains that he was interrogated
by US officials in Pakistan,
and that the American told him that they were going to send him to a country
where he could be interrogated "more freely." He reported that US interrogators thought that detention in Jordan
"was more suitable for people like me because American laws tie their hands and
they cannot apply the methods of the Jordanians."
Here is his description of what happened to him in GID
detention in Amman:
Al-Tabuki claimed that the point of the abuse was to obtain
information, even false information:
A prisoner who was held with al-Tabuki in Jordan told Human Rights Watch that al-Tabuki
was returned to Saudi Arabia
in late 2002 or early 2003, and was released.
Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni citizen, was arrested in Karachi, Pakistan,
on September 11, 2002, and was held in CIA custody for several years.Â  Alleged to be one of the main conspirators in
the September 11 attacks, he was rendered by the United
 States to Jordan
for an unknown period.Â  In early
September 2006, he was transferred to US
military detention at Guantanamo,
where he remains.Â  He has yet to see a
lawyer or an independent monitor who could report on his experiences since his
arrest.
A former detainee in Jordan gave Human Rights Watch a
detailed account of being held in a cell next to al-Shibh's in late 2002, on
the third floor of the GID detention facility.Â 
The source said that he spoke with al-Shibh through the back window of
his cell and sometimes through the small vent in the door of the cell.Â  "We could never talk for long," he said,
"maybe two minutes at most."
According to this source, al-Shibh claimed that he had been
arrested in Pakistan, then
brought to the US air base
at Bagram, in Afghanistan,
then flown to Jordan via Qatar.Â  Al-Shibh described the flight from Bagram,
saying that US officials put him in a diaper and wrapped a giant bandage around
his body.
Al-Shibh reportedly said that he had been badly tortured in
Jordanian custody.Â  The forms of abuse
included electric shocks, long periods of sleep deprivation, forced nakedness,
and being made to sit on sticks and bottles (a form of sexual violence).Â  The source did not recall al-Shibh saying
anything about how the Americans treated him.
Al-Shibh reportedly claimed that he had been brought to Jordan together
with two or three other prisoners.Â  Human
Rights Watch's source said that al-Shibh was the "most important" of the group,
but he did not know anything about the others, except that one or more of them
may have been Egyptian.
Ali al-Hajj al-Sharqawi (also known as Riad al-Sharqawi or
Shergawi) is a Yemeni citizen who was arrested in Karachi
in mid-February 2002, and rendered by the US
to Jordan
soon after.Â  He is now held at Guantanamo.
Two former prisoners held by the GID spoke to Human Rights
Watch about al-Sharqawi.[43]Â  In addition, while at the GID detention
facility in late 2002, al-Sharqawi himself wrote a long note describing his
ordeal, which another prisoner managed to smuggle out, and which was provided
to Human Rights Watch.Â  Human Rights
Watch also obtained a statement that al-Sharqawi wrote in 2006, two years after
he was moved to Guantanamo.
In the 2006 statement, al-Sharqawi described his transfer to
Jordan:
Like al-Tabuki, al-Sharqawi was surprised to find himself in
Jordan:
A prisoner held with al-Sharqawi in GID detention told Human
Rights Watch that al-Sharqawi was badly beaten by GID interrogators.Â  Al-Sharqawi described the interrogations,
saying:
Al-Sharqawi was
held in GID detention for nearly two years.Â 
Flight records obtained by Human Rights Watch indicate that a Boeing 737,
registration number N313P, linked to the CIA and other prisoner transports,
traveled from Amman to Kabul
on January 8, 2004,
the date that al-Sharqawi claims that he was flown from Jordan to Kabul.[45]Â  Al-Sharqawi told his lawyers about what
happened on that trip.Â  Their notes of
his account state:
Hassan bin Attash (whom Jordanian former detainees remember
as Hassan ba Attash) is a Yemeni born in Saudi Arabia.Â  He is the younger brother of Walid bin
Attash, an alleged Al Qaeda operative who spent more than three years in secret
CIA custody before being transferred to Guantanamo
in 2006.Â  The younger bin Attash was
approximately 17 years old on September 11, 2002, when he was arrested in Karachi, Pakistan,
in a raid that resulted in the arrest of Ramzi bin al-Shibh and several other
Yemenis.
Bin Attash has told his lawyers that during a four-day period after his arrest he
was held in a Karachi jail, where he was hit and
kicked repeatedly while being questioned by Pakistani and American
interrogators.Â  After three nights there,
he was transferred to a US-run
facility in Kabul, Afghanistan, which he and other
prisoners know as the "Dark Prison."
Bin Attash claims that after three days in Afghanistan the UStransferred him to Jordan.Â  He has told his lawyers that while in GID
custody in Jordan,
he was subject to severe torture by Jordanian interrogators, including sleep
deprivation; being slapped in the face and ears; being beaten on his feet with
large sticks and being forced to run on his bare feet afterwards.[48]
He has described his torture in detail to his lawyers, who
summarized it as follows:
A Jordanian who was detained with bin Attash remembered his
mistreatment.[50]
He said that bin Attash, like al-Sharqawi, was beaten more severely than him or
most other prisoners.Â  Also, he recalled,
"the guards didn't allow ba Attash [bin Attash] to sleep.Â  The guards would look in on him through the
small window in his cell door.Â  If they
saw that his eyes were closed, they'd wake him up by slapping his face or
spraying water on him."
A habeas petition filed in US federal court summarizes the
treatment bin Attash endured:
Bin Attash says
that he was returned from Jordan
to Afghanistan
in January 2004, almost certainly on the same flight as Sharqawi.Â  His lawyer has related his account of the
trip:
In September 2004
he was flown from Afghanistan
to Guantanamo,
where he remains in custody.
One former prisoner told Human Rights Watch that in early
2003 he was briefly held in a GID cell near a Kurd named Khais.Â  Khais was said to be in his twenties, and was
from Halabja, in the Kurdish region of Iraq.[53]Â  The person said that Khais may have been
arrested in Yemen and delivered
to Jordan
by US agents.
Another former prisoner detained at the GID facility in 2004
and 2005 claims that a guard spoke of a Libyan prisoner who had been rendered
by the Americans. The rendered prisoner was reportedly held on the very top
floor of the GID facility, away from all the other prisoners.Â  Human Rights Watch's source said that the
guard said that:
The source said that the Libyan figured out where he was,
however, after one of the Jordanian officers accidentally spoke in front of
him.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
The source thought the prisoner's name was Ibn al-Sheikh
al-Libi, but he was not certain.Â  Human
Rights Watch has learned through other sources that al-Libi (who the United
States rendered to Egypt for a time as well) believes that he was held in
Jordan for a couple of months.[54]
Another former detainee, who was held by the GID in 2004,
told Human Rights Watch that he was held in a cell adjoining that of a Tunisian
prisoner who had been delivered to Jordan by US authorities.Â  The Tunisian was said to have been unhappy
because he had been in custody for a long time: "He complained that he had
spent four months in GID, and before that three months in an American prison in
Iraq."
The Tunisian reportedly said that he had been detained in
northern Iraq
by the Peshmerga (Kurdish militants), who handed him over to US authorities.[55]Â  He said that he had been a mujahid (fighter) for five years.Â  GID interrogators had reportedly showed him
photos of other mujahideen whom he
did not know. "They said that if he didn't confess they'd send him to Guantanamo or Tunisia," the former detainee told
Human Rights Watch.
The former detainee said that he only saw the Tunisian once,
through the vent in his cell door.Â  He
described the Tunisian as short, slim, balding, and in his early thirties.Â  The Tunisian reportedly said that his father
was dead, and that he was his mother's only source of support.
Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed, a Yemeni student who lived in Karachi, Pakistan,
was reportedly flown to Jordan
on a CIA-linked Gulfstream jet, registration number N379P, in the early morning
hours of October 23, 2001.[56]Â  Someone who witnessed the scene at the Karachi airport reported
that Mohammed was shackled and blindfolded.Â 
He said that the plane arrived from Amman and started flying back there at 2:40 a.m.
A Pakistani journalist quoted a source at the Karachi airport saying:
"The entire operation was so mysterious that all persons involved in the
operation, including US troops, were wearing masks."[57] He
also claimed that a masked person filmed the operation.
Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed has not been seen or heard from
since. 
Mohamedou Ould Slahi is a 37-year-old Mauritanian citizen
who voluntarily submitted himself for questioning by the Mauritanian
authorities in September 2001 and again in November 2001.Â  In the report of the US National Commission
on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission), Slahi is
described as "a significant al Qaeda operative," but these allegations have
never been tested in court.Â  Although he
has acknowledged fighting in Afghanistan
in the early 1990s, he claims that he broke all relations with al Qaeda in
1992.
Arrested and transferred to US custody in November 2001, Slahi
has been detained without trial ever since.Â 
He has said that he was flown to Jordan on approximately November28, 2001, and that he was held in
custody there for eight months.Â  He
claims that during that time he was hit in the face and slammed against a
concrete wall many times by Jordanian interrogators, and that he sometimes
heard crying and moaning, presumably from other prisoners.Â  What happened to him in Jordan, he later said, was "beyond
description."[58]Â  He has said that he confessed to involvement
in the 2000 plot to blow up US airports, because "in Jordan they made me crazy to admit
I had something to do with it.Â  Because
there was so much pressure and mistreatment, I admitted to this."[59]
Slahi claims that he was flown from Jordan to Afghanistan on July 19, 2002. This
is consistent with flight information from a known CIA detainee transport
plane, registration number N379P, which flew from Amman
to Kabul on
that date.Â  On the day he was
transferred, he later explained, "they stripped me naked like my mom bore me,
and they put new clothes on me."[60]Â  
After spending three weeks in US military custody at Bagram air
base, Slahi was transferred to GuantÃ¡namo on August 4, 2002.Â 
He is still there now.
Jamal al-Mar'i, a Yemeni who is currently being held at Guantanamo, was arrested at his home in Karachi, Pakistan,
on September 23, 2001.[62]Â  The arrest was carried out by a joint
Pakistani-US team of operatives.Â  Upon
his arrest, he was taken to a Pakistani jail where he was held for
approximately a month.Â  While held at
this facility, al-Mar'i claims that he was interrogated two or three times
during a single week by US personnel, who he believes were intelligence
agents.Â  In late October 2001, al-Mar'i
was rendered to Jordan,
where he was held in the custody of the GID.Â 

Al-Mar'i, like other rendered prisoners, has said that he
was hidden from the ICRC during their regular visits to the facility, generally
in the basement.Â  During one of the
ICRC's visits, however, al-Mar'i was "not taken into the basement and was
discovered by the ICRC."Â  Unlike other
rendered prisoners, al-Mar'i has not claimed that he was tortured while in GID
custody.
Al-Mar'i has told his lawyers that he was imprisoned for
four months in Jordan.
In mid-2002, he was taken to Guantanamo,
where he remains.
The systematic rendition of individuals to Jordan by the United States in the years
following the September 11 attacks violated several fundamental human rights
guarantees. These include the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, torture and
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and enforced disappearance.[63]
The Jordanian government violated both national law and
international human rights law by torturing and otherwise mistreating rendered
detainees, by detaining them without charge or trial, and by holding them
incommunicado, without contact or visits by family members or legal counsel.
By rendering prisoners to Jordan, the United States
specifically violated its obligations under the Convention against Torture and
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention against
Torture), which it ratified in 1994.[64]Â  The Convention against Torture defines
torture as "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or
mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining
from him or a third person information or a confession" and when "inflicted by
or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public
official or other person acting in an official capacity."[65]Â  States violate the Convention against Torture
not only by directly inflicting torture, like Jordan, but also, under article
3, when they "expel, return ('refouler') or extradite a person to another State
where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of
being subjected to torture."[66]
Rendition to torture is thus a clear violation of the
prohibition against torture.Â  In 2006,
the UN Committee against Torture, the international expert body responsible for
monitoring state compliance with the Convention against Torture, expressed
concern with the US contention
that the non-refoulement obligation under the convention did not extend to
persons detained outside of the United
  States. It maintained that the US
government's "rendition of suspects, without any judicial procedure, to States
where they face a real risk of torture" was a violation of the Convention
against Torture.[67]Â  The committee called upon the United States
to: 
Notably, in the case of Agiza
v. Sweden, the Committee against Torture held that Sweden violated the Convention
against Torture when it assisted in the CIA's rendition to Egypt of Egyptian
asylum seeker Ahmed Agiza in December 2001.Â 
The Committee found that "it was known, or should have been known, to
[Sweden]'s authorities at the time of [Agiza]'s removal that Egypt resorted to
consistent and widespread use of torture against detainees, and that the risk
of such treatment was particularly high in the case of detainees held for
political and security reasons."[69]Â  The Committee also stated that "an inability
to contest an expulsion decision before an independent authority . . . [is]
relevant to a finding of a violation of [the Convention]" because it violates
"the procedural obligation to provide for effective, independent and impartial
review required by article 3 of the Convention."[70]
Importantly, the Committee rejected Sweden's argument that it should be
not be found responsible because it had obtained assurances from the Egyptian
government that Agiza would not be ill-treated.Â 
As the Committee emphasized, the "procurement of diplomatic assurances,
which, moreover, provided no mechanism for their enforcement, did not suffice
to protect against this manifest risk."[71]Â  In its 2006 Conclusions and Recommendations
to the United States, the
Committee called upon the US
government to "provide detailed information to the Committee on all cases since
11 September 2001 where assurances have been provided."[72]
Numerous other international authorities have criticized the
use of diplomatic assurances in cases involving returns to a risk of torture,
finding that they do not provide effective protection.[73]Â  Human Rights Watch has shown, as an empirical
matter, that such assurances are often unreliable, and that persons who have
been returned to their home countries on the basis of such assurances have
faced torture and other abuse.[74]Â  The brutal torture endured by Maher Arar-a
Canadian-Syrian dual national whom the United States rendered to Syria, via
Jordan-is perhaps the most notorious example of this problem.[75]
International human rights law provides victims of rights
violations the right to an effective remedy.Â 
In cases where people have endured torture as a result of US actions,
they should be able to seek legal redress in court.Â  The International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights provides that states shall "ensure that any person whose
rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective
remedy" for abuses by persons acting in an official capacity, that anyone
claiming such a remedy shall have this right determined by competent
governmental authorities, and that states shall ensure that remedies are
enforced.[76]
Under the Convention against Torture, in addition, torture
victims have a right of access to the courts in order to obtain fair and
adequate compensation.[77]Â  To date, however, the US courts have proven hostile to
victims of rendition, dismissing a lawsuit brought by a group of rendition
victims that include Ahmed Agiza, Abou Elkassim Britel and Binyam Mohamed, as
well as an earlier suit brought by rendition victim Maher Arar.[78]Â  While the Canadian government acknowledged
wrongdoing and compensated Arar for his suffering, the US government has done
neither.Â  Indeed, despite heavy
international criticism, the US
government has never acknowledged that the CIA's rendition program has resulted
in abuses or has violated the law.[79]

The General Intelligence Department was established in 1964. Law No. 24 of 1964
mandates the GID to work "for the security and safety" (salama) of Jordan.Â  The law stipulates that the prime minister
shall designate the GID's specific duties in writing and that these are to
remain confidential.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The
king of Jordan
appoints the GID director, who reports to the prime minister. GID officers are
considered military personnel.Â  For detailed information about the GID and

Ken Silverstein, a journalist who follows intelligence issues closely, claims
that the GID "has surpassed Israel's
Mossad as America's most
effective allied counter-terrorism agency in the Middle
 East."Â  A former CIA official
told Silverstein that "Jordan's
intelligence partnership with the U.S. is so close ... that the CIA

The falaqa technique has a long
history; it is believed to have been used in the Arab world since the tenth
century.Â  As one expert on torture
explained, "[t]he soles of the feet are not thickly muscled, and so caning or
whipping them is especially painful.Â 
Depending on the weight of the rod and the intensity and frequency of
the blows, this practice can yield mildly swollen feet to broken bones that
damage a person permanently."Â  Part of
attraction of this method, in modern times, is that its physical traces
disappear quickly.Â  Darius Rejali, Torture and Democracy (Princeton and Oxford: PrincetonUniversity Press, 2007),

allegedly located there.Â  Their reports
have been incomplete, however, and based on information received from Guantanamo detainees and

the rendered suspects.Â  See, for example,

October 13, 2004 (stating that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Abu
Zubaydah, and Hambali were among at least 11 senior Al Qaeda suspects held in
CIA custody in Jordan); Ken Silverstein, "U.S. partnership with Jordan was

April 26, 2006 (stating that Mohamedou Ould Slahi, Jamal Mar'i, Hassan bin
Attash, and Al-Shaqwi (Ali al-Hajj al-Sharqawi) were rendered to Jordan); and

[24]
In contrast, all the people whom the US
rendered to Egypt
prior to September 2001 were Egyptian citizens over whom the Egyptian
government was clearly eager to obtain custody.Â 
Moreover, nearly all of the people known to have been rendered to Egypt after
September 2001 are also Egyptian citizens, although in some of the cases it
does not appear that the Egyptian government had a strong interest in detaining
them.
[25]
The two men are Muhammad Faraj Bashmilah and Salah Nasir Salim 'Ali Qaru
(Darwish).Â  They were arrested in October
and September 2003, respectively.Â  After
relatively brief periods of detention in Jordan,
they were transported by the US
to Afghanistan
where they were secretly detained.Â  See

Hamza al-Tabuki, Jordanian Intelligence and its Services to US Intelligence in
its War on the Mujahidun and Iraq,
written in early 2003 (hereinafter al-Tabuki account) (copy on file at Human
Rights Watch.Â  On a visit to the GID
detention facility in August 2007, Human Rights Watch was prevented from freely
visiting the guards' quarters, which are located in the outer walls of the same
two triangular buildings, easily accessible through doors that were locked at
the time of our visit. We were able to see the guards' washroom and one large
room with bunk beds for guards. It was clear that within the larger building
there were rooms in which prisoners could be hidden.
[36]
The FBI posted the names of 17 suspected terrorists to the list on February 11,
2002.Â  By late March 2002, his name had
been removed from the list.Â  See http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/terrorismsi.htm.Â  Arabic names can be transcribed into Latin
script in several different ways, leading.
[37] Abu
Hamza al-Tabuki remembered that Abu Mu'ath was mostly held in cell number 87,
on the third floor of the GID detention facility.Â  Al-Tabuki account, p. 3.Â  He also said Abu Mu'ath's real name was Ahmad
Ibrahim Abu al-Hasana.
[38]
The memo states: "The detainee was recruited in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [sometime
before August 2001], by Abu Mua'th, who gave the detainee an airline ticket to
Karachi, Pakistan, 3000 Saudi Riyals ($799 USD) and a passport."Â  Department of Defense, Office for the

Review Board in the Case of Khowlan, Abdul Rahman Mohammed Hussein," June 29,
2005.Â  The summary of evidence memo used
in Khowlan's case the following year omits the name of Abu Mu'ath, but identifies
him as "a Saudi in his early 30s," which corresponds to al-Jeddawi's
description.Â  Department of Defense,

Arar was arrested by US officials at JohnF.KennedyAirport in New
 York on September 26, 2002, held for nearly two weeks in
immigration detention, and subsequently rendered to Jordan,
from which he was driven to Syria.

respect to states' jurisdiction for human rights violations:
States Parties
are required by article 2, paragraph 1, to respect and to ensure the Covenant
rights to all persons who may be within their territory and to all persons
subject to their jurisdiction. This means that a State Party must respect and
ensure the rights laid down in the Covenant to anyone within the power or
effective control of that State Party, even if not situated within the
territory of the State Party.

The Center for Constitutional Rights filed suit on behalf of Maher Arar in the
US District Court for the Eastern District of New York in January 2004, naming Attorney
General John Ashcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller, Homeland Security DirectorTomRidge, and others, as
defendants.Â  The court granted the
government's motion to dismiss Arar's suit in 2006, finding that the case
implicated sensitive national security and foreign policy considerations.Â  Arar appealed, and in November 2007, Arar's
lawyers argued before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that the
district court's ruling should be reversed.Â 
A decision is currently pending.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed suit on behalf of Ahmed Agiza, Abou
Elkassim Britel and Binyam Mohamed (later adding Bisher al-Rawi and Mohamed
Farag Ahmad Bashmilah as plaintiffs ) in a case against Boeing subsidiary
Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., the company that allegedly provided flight services
for the CIA's rendition program.Â  The
complaint was dismissed in February 2008 based on the U.S.
government's claim that the case would reveal state secrets and endanger
relations with countries that had cooperated in the renditions.Â  The ACLU has announced plans to appeal.
[79]
The closest any senior US
government official has come to publicly expressing regret in a rendition case
came at an October 2007 hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, when
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice admitted that the US government
"mishandled" the case of Maher Arar.Â  Rice
reportedly "sounded contrite" but did not apologize.Â  Deborah Charles, "U.S.
mishandled case of Canada's
Arar, admits Rice," Reuters, October 24, 2007.

example.com is now pending inclusion in the HSTS preload list!
        
Please make sure that example.com continues to satisfy all preload requirements, or it will be removed. Please revisit this site over the next few weeks to check on the status of your domain.
Also consider scanning for TLS issues using SSL Labs.

      This form is used to submit domains for inclusion in Chrome's HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list.
      This is a list of sites that are hardcoded into Chrome as being HTTPS only.
    

      Most major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE 11 and Edge) also have HSTS preload lists based on the Chrome list. (See the HSTS compatibility matrix.)
    
If a site sends the preload directive in an HSTS header, it is considered to be requesting inclusion in the preload list and may be submitted via the form on this site.
In order to be accepted to the HSTS preload list through this form, your site must satisfy the following set of requirements:

      For more details on HSTS, please see RFC 6797.

      Here is an example of a valid HSTS header:
    

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload


      You can check the status of your request by entering the domain name again in the form above, or consult the current Chrome preload list by visiting chrome://net-internals/#hsts in your browser.
      Note that new entries are hardcoded into the Chrome source code and can take several months before they reach the stable version.
    

      You must make sure your site continues to satisfy the submission requirements at all times. Note that removing the preload directive from your header will make your site immediately eligible for the removal form, and that sites may be removed automatically in the future for failing to keep up the requirements.
    

      In particular, the requirements above apply to all domains submitted through hstspreload.org on or after October 11, 2017 (i.e. preloaded after Chrome 63)
    

      The same requirements apply to earlier domains submitted on or after February 29, 2016 (i.e. preloaded after Chrome 50), except that the required max-age for those domains is only 10886400 seconds.
    

      If your site is committed to HTTPS and you want to preload HSTS, we suggest the following steps:
    

      If you have a group of employees or users who can beta test the deployment, consider trying the first few ramp-up stages on those users. Then make sure to go through all stages for all users, starting over from the beginning.
    

      Consult the Mozilla Web Security guidelines and the Google Web Fundamentals pages on security for more concrete advice about HTTPS deployment.
    

      If you maintain a project that provides HTTPS configuration advice or provides an option to enable HSTS, do not include the preload directive by default. We get regular emails from site operators who tried out HSTS this way, only to find themselves on the preload list by the time they find they need to remove HSTS to access certain subdomains. Removal tends to be slow and painful for those sites.
    

      Projects that support or advise about HSTS and HSTS preloading should ensure that site operators understand the long-term consequences of preloading before they turn it on for a given domain. They should also be informed that they need to meet additional requirements and submit their site to hstspreload.org to ensure that it is successfully preloaded (i.e. to get the full protection of the intended configuration).
    

      Be aware that inclusion in the preload list cannot easily be undone.
      Domains can be removed, but it takes months for a change to reach users with a Chrome update and we cannot make guarantees about other browsers.
      Don't request inclusion unless you're sure that you can support HTTPS for your entire site and all its subdomains in the long term.
    

      However, we will generally honor requests to be removed from Chrome's preload list if you find that you have a subdomain that you cannot serve over HTTPS for strong technical or cost reasons.
      To request removal, please visit the removal form.
    

      Owners of gTLDs, ccTLDs, or any other public suffix domains are welcome to preload HSTS across all their registerable domains. This ensures robust security for the whole TLD, and is much simpler than preloading each individual domain. Please contact us if you're interested, or would like to learn more.
    

Want to remove your domain? Please visit the removal form.
    

      Else, if you have questions or requests that are not covered by this site, email us here using an appropriate subject line and one of the preload list maintainers will be in contact soon.

Monero is a cryptocurrency that has rapidly gained popularity since
its launch in April 2014. The source of its growth can be mainly
attributed to its unique privacy properties that go well beyond the
pseudonymity property of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
In this work, we conduct a forensic analysis of the Monero
blockchain. Our main goal is to investigate Moneroâs untraceability
guarantee, which essentially means that given a transaction input,
the real output being redeemed in it should be anonymous among
a set of other outputs. To this end, we develop three heuristics that
lead to simple-to-implement attack routines.

We evaluate our attacks on the Monero blockchain and show
that in 87% of cases, the real output being redeemed can be easily
identified with certainty. Moreover, we have compelling evidence
that two of our attacks also extend to Monero RingCTs â the second
generation Monero that even hides the transaction value.
Furthermore, we observe that for over 98% of the inputs that
we have been able to trace, the real output being redeemed in it
is the one that has been on the blockchain for the shortest period
of time. This result shows that the mitigation measures currently
employed in Monero fall short of preventing temporal analysis.

Motivated by our findings, we also propose a new mitigation strategy
against temporal analysis. Our mitigation strategy leverages the
real spending habit of Monero users.

Summary: Set in a plausible alternate future, "Watch Dogs: Legion" is the third open-world action-adventure game in the Watch Dogs series, following on from the events of both previous games.
Set in a plausible alternate future, “Watch Dogs: Legion” is the third open world action adventure game in the Watch Dogs series, following on from the events of both previous games. Now taking place in London, the game follows the London Branch of the DedSec hacking group as they try to rebuild their organisation after being framed for a series of terrorist attacks across the British capital. New game mechanics now allow players to recruit and play as anyone within the game, opening up endless possibilities for gameplay as they take back London from an unchecked paramilitary police force and discover the true identity of the bomber known only as Zero-Day.
Gameplay
For many years, weâve all talked and joked about how the government is spying on us, how corporations buy and sell our data to influence what we do, and that there is always someone watching. From George Orwellâs novel “1984” to reality TV show “Big Brother”, the notion of always being watched has always seemed to be a plausible concept but usually played off as been purely hypothetical and nothing to be concerned about. But what would it look like if it was to actually happen? What would it take for governments to embrace this technology and denounce the privacy of itâs citizens in exchange for an all seeing eye? In a technological world, a series of terrorist attack bombings across London that framed the hacker group DedSec as the culprits was all it took for their government to employ the private paramilitary security company Albion and let them rain supreme as they hunt down anyone who they think is a member of DedSec or even likely to join them. With the London branch of a global hacker group in disarray, it is up to the player to rebuild DedSec, recruit new members, uncover the true culprits behind the bombings, and take down Albion in the process.

Watch Dog: Legion doesnât waste any time throwing players into the deep end and bringing them up to speed with the brand new âplay as anyoneâ game mechanics. This incredible feature literally does what it sounds like: letting players pick any NPC within the game and require them into the DedSec family after completing various missions or tasks to gain their favour and trust. However, getting someone to join your team isnât always a simple task as not everyone has a positive opinion of DedSec after been framed for the London bombings. Most people can be won over by completing a few missions such as helping out a friend with legal issues, rescuing them from gang members, or in one particular case, infiltrate an Albion stronghold because the person youâre trying to requit is convinced of an alien conspiracy. Every NPC is vastly unique and comes with their own set of skills and abilities based on their interests, social situation, and career. For example, people who have a day job that requires wearing a uniform such as a gang member or law enforcer, come with a perk that lets them enter restricted zones that would normally be off limits to the general public. Others might have perks that assist your other DedSec members such as medical staff that help your team recover from hospital quicker. However, not all perks are positive and can be quite deadly ranging from having a pre-existing criminal record that increases their jail time, or uncontrollable gas that gives away their position when hiding, to having a medical condition that could kill them at any given point.
However, players should be cautious of who they help, kill, and injure due to the complex social networks the NPCs have. Every action has the potential to indirectly influence a personâs opinion of DedSec, just as it would in real life. Knocking someone out will instantly leave that person hating you and the chances of them joining your team is next to zero. On the other end of the scale, helping people that are been detained or harassed by Albion can create a positive effect and make them easier to requit. Regardless of what direct action the player makes towards one person can also create a ripple effect that then influences the opinions of their friends, family, and rivals, making it either harder or easier for you to recruit those people as well. In one particular situation, I was trying to requit a gang member so I could use her uniform perk to infiltrate a gang stronghold but because I had already requited her rival, she had no interest in joining. This can be particularly frustrating if you are playing âpermadeathâ mode where once your character dies, it becomes permanent and youâll need to find a new requit to replace the new vacancy on your team.

With the new generation of Xbox and PlayStation console around the corner, playing “Watch Dogs: Legion” on an Xbox One S is still a spectacular sight to be seen. Choosing London as the next location for a Watch Dogs game feels like a perfect fit and seeing the iconic landmarks transformed with neon lights and giant holograms pushing pro Albion propaganda further imerses players into what could be a plausible future. The map is broken up into Londonâs iconic burrows that surround the River Thames, each with their distinct cultural personalities and landmarks. Whilst many gamers will be keen to explore the globally renowned landmarks such as Buckenham Palace, Tower Bridge, and the London Eye, the real attention to detail can be found in the way the locals go about their every day lives and react to the changes in the world around them. As the player progresses through each burrow, removing propaganda and freeing the region from Albion control, NPCs will become easier to recruit and the overall mood improved. But my personal favourite was watching how people reacted to the discovery of an unconscious security guard that Iâd politely told to have a long nap using a studded baseball bat. With my cover still intact, I watched as another guard ran over once the body was discovered and started calling for help. Shortly after, a security drone had flown in to provide backup while the guard knelt over the body. Around them, onlookers stopped to watch the scene unfold before feeling the need to move on. I felt that this would be exactly the way people would react if the situation had occurred in real life.

Focusing on the storyline of “Watch Dogs: Legion”, players are in for quite an intense ride through the darker side of the digital world and how people with power could easily abuse it for all the wrong reasons. Despite Watch Dogs 2 being such a bright and colourful game, “Legion” feels much more bleak and leans towards an almost darker tone than that of the first Watch Dogs game that had missions featuring human trafficking and a serial killer. After playing a few missions, players are introduced to the notorious Kelly Gang and their ring of human trafficking, slavery, and organ harvesting. In one mission, I found myself walking through a morgue as a mortician hacked at a dead body with power tools. Thankfully, there was not any vital organs on display but such an act occuring only a few hours into the game really sets the game up for some dark undertones. Furthermore, back on the streets of London, Albion has taken to setting up checkpoints and guards to randomly check peoples ID. Often, Iâll hear the guards talking about curfews or threatening civilians with detention, and it feels a bit too close to home given current world events. On one side it makes the game feel more believable and that a future like this could be very plausible, but at the same time, it might hit home a bit hard for those experiencing similar restrictions. I can only recommend that gamers come into “Watch Dogs: Legion” with an open mind.
Final Thoughts
Without a doubt, “Watch Dogs: Legion” ticks all the boxes required to be a true Watch Dogs game, embracing elements from both previous games while brining its own flavour to the table. Iâm a huge fan of the âplay as anyoneâ approach to creating an underground resistance and the level of diversity in ways people require your help before joining DedSec. Gamers will have a lot of fun searching for some of the Easter Egg characters such as Bonnie Brown, the drone expert that resembles Doc from “Back to The Future”. Personally, Iâm glad that “Legion” took a darker turn and really explored the true possibilities of how technology can be used for malice purposes, as it gives the player a real sense of triumph taking down these digital villains. I do recommend caution for younger gamers, as “Legion” is definitely aimed at an older audience. Regardless, “Watch Dogs: Legion” has an enormous amount of replay value and a very compelling storyline with unexpected twists along the way.

Mr Trump again claimed falsely that he had âwonâ the election
Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile
Donald Trump has accused Pfizer and Moderna of working to stop his re-election by delaying their Covid vaccines.
The outgoing president again made the false claim he had âwonâ the election as he gave a White House press conference on lowering drug prices.
And he claimed that regardless of a vaccine breakthrough the Democrats would âhave found the ballots someplaceâ to beat him.
âBig pharma ran millions of dollars of negative advertisements against me during the campaign, which I won by the way,â said Mr Trump.
Follow live: New Covid outbreak hits White House
âBut you know, weâll find out.
âAlmost 74 million votes. We had big pharma against us, the media against us, big tech against us and a lot of dishonesty against us.â
Mr Trump then took shots at the drug companies who announced their successful vaccines in the wake of the presidential election.
âPfizer and others were way ahead on vaccines, you wouldnât have a vaccine if it wasnât me for another four years,â he said.
âPfizer and others even decided to not assess the results of their vaccine, in other words not come out with the vaccine, until just after the election.â
During his election campaign the president often claimed the drug companies would release the vaccine after the country voted.
Both companies have refuted such claims and said that the results of vaccine trials were not manipulated by political concerns.
Pfizerâs vaccine has been tested to be 95 per cent effective and Modernaâs 94. 5 per cent.
Mr Trump insisted that the firms had acted against him in retaliation over his executive orders to lower drug prices.
âInstead of their original plan to asses them in October, they were going to come out with it in October, they decided to delay it because of what I am doing, which is fine with me, because frankly it is just a very big thing, what I am doing here," Mr Trump claimed.
Mr Trump then said that release of the vaccine news before the election could have helped him defeat Joe Biden.
âSo they waited and waited and waited and thought they would come out with it a few days after the election, and it would probably have had an impact, who knows maybe it wouldnât have,â he complained.
"I am sure they would probably have found the ballots someplace, the Democrats and the group.â

“Rust” armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed told detectives she checked the dummy rounds on set “most of the time,” a line prosecutors in her ongoing trial underscored to the jury as they aim to prove involuntary manslaughter. 
On Tuesday, February, 27, the jury in the ongoing “Rust” trial in New Mexico saw videos of interviews Santa Fe detectives conducted with Gutierrez-Reed in November 2021 after the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the “Rust” set. In the videos, she described her responsibilities and her process for checking for the safety of dummy rounds, which involves shaking each individual round to hear for a rattle to indicate they are a dummy and cannot be fired. 
“I am shaking all of them most of the time,” Gutierrez-Reed said.
However, Gutierrez-Reed clarified earlier in the same interview that she had checked all of the rounds, that they had rattled, and she “dummied up the gun” upon first loading it before taking a lunch break. She did not notice there was a live round that had been loaded into the gun that was later handed to Baldwin.

“I went back through a bag that I had,” Gutierrez-Reed said in the interview. “This bag had a bunch of loose dummies in it. I went through, and I checked all of them, and I put them into two boxes… They were in my car for like two weeks.”


“If it didn’t rattle, I wouldn’t have put it in,” she added. “I checked all six of them for a rattle.”
Among the new details revealed in court were that Gutierrez-Reed brought dummy rounds that she had leftover from her previous film job, “The Old Way,” starring Nicolas Cage. The video interview with the detectives also revealed a text exchange in which the investigators sent Gutierrez-Reed an image of the live round that had been pulled from Hutchins and asked her if she thought it looked like a live round. 
“That looks like a blank one,” Gutierrez said at first before later saying, “That might be a regular live round, though.”
“That’s what they were thinking — it could be a live round,” the investigator said.
“Holy fuck,” Gutierrez said.
Prosecutors will have to prove without a reasonable doubt that Gutierrez-Reed demonstrated “willful disregard for the safety of others.” If she is convicted, she could face 18 months in prison. 

 









Gutierrez-Reed’s trial began February 22. Prosecutor Jason Lewis said Gutierrez-Reed was “sloppy” in her duties as the armorer, twice failing to check the ammunition in the gun properly. Prosecutors made the case that Gutierrez-Reed was unprofessional, and in pre-trial filings, prosecutors noted she was allegedly hungover while on the job and had been using marijuana, potentially impairing her work. Earlier in the week, a former crew member took the stand and testified that Gutierrez-Reed was not as professional as other armorers he had worked with in his career. 
Gutierrez-Reed’s lawyer, Todd Bowles, pointed the finger in her defense at numerous other parties, saying that a series of events and mishaps all had to occur for a gun to discharge on set and kill Hutchins. Bowles said his client was being made to be a “scapegoat” and that the entire mentality on “Rust” was “rush, get this done, so we can get the money.” Her defense argues that Baldwin was at fault for pointing the gun at another individual, and he also singled out supplier Seth Kenney, prop master Sarah Zachry, and the producers of “Rust,” who were issued the largest fine in New Mexico history by OSHA for failing to maintain safe working conditions. 
Gutierrez-Reed is charged with involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering. Baldwin was again charged with involuntary manslaughter in the “Rust” case and will begin his trial on July 9.

Maciej Michalski, a gnarly body piercer who looks like Darth Maul, told me that his friend was missing, possibly kidnapped.
He looked rad, so I wanted to help. He was one of many different people in Watch Dogs: Legion's vision of London I could recruit to join DedSec, a hacking collective seeking to undermine the dystopian tyrannical forces that are controlling the city.
So, after completing one of Watch Dogs: Legionâs main story missions in the early hours of the game, I drove across London to reach an objective to investigate the kidnapping. Like most Grand Theft Auto-style games, I cut a few corners and âaccidentallyâ hit some pedestrians. But in this game, these kinds of sidewalk shenanigans have far greater consequences.
Must read: Everything you need to know about Watch Dogs: Legion.
I hit a character labeled âpotential recruitâ with my car. I got out, hoping it would be some random person. But Maciej Michalski was dead. He was also no longer recruitable due to permadeath mode. The whole mission was a wash.
Characters will wear masks during combat in 'Watch Dogs: Legion'.
This mess-up cements how Watch Dogs: Legionâs âPlay as Anyoneâ promise goes far deeper than a mere gimmick. Your actions have consequences in a way that similar games have never been able to achieve.
Ubisoft mostly releases cookie-cutter open-world games that havenât evolved much since Far Cry 3 cemented the formula back in 2012. Drive around an open world, clear outposts, and free regions on repeat. At its high points, Watch Dogs: Legion bucks that trend to become one of the most exciting open-world games of the year.
Unfortunately, those highs are offset by moments when the game becomes bogged down by the weight of its ambition. The cracks in its design start to show. Maciej Michalski made a mark on me, but that faded when I heard the same sob story from a totally different potential recruit ... and the game crashed a few minutes later.
In one of the most original open-world mechanics in years, Watch Dogs: Legion lets players recruit anyone in London to join DedSec. (Hence the âPlay as Anyoneâ label.) This ties into the story, which follows DedSecâs attempts to rebuild following a series of bombings around London that led to the tyrannical private military contractor called Albion taking over.
Like previous Watch Dogs games, every person you encounter has a brief character description, but this latest installment goes several steps deeper by simulating robust schedules and relationships for each of them. They even get spoken lines of dialogue delivered by voice actors. This gives the core gameplay loop a refreshing sense of variety and spontaneity. You could potentially clear out an enemy base by recruiting everyone in it or just recruit one of them to sneak through among their former allies.
Every character comes with one to four special abilities, which typically boil down to a mix of special weapons, vehicles, drones, or access to certain areas of London. The scale at which Ubisoft was able to implement this is jaw-dropping. It really makes the world feel alive.
After the traumatic experience of hitting a potential recruit, I paid closer attention to watching my potential allies, their friends, and their adversaries throughout London. Turns out, the whole âPlay as Anyoneâ pitch isnât just smoke and mirrors.
Specialty and loadout changes add an even greater variety of approaches to any given situation. In that way, Watch Dogs: Legion is on par with games like Breath of the Wild that give players true freedom in how they approach objectives.
Watch Dogs: Legionâs multi-character setup allows it to turn the weaknesses of previous Ubisoft open-world games into strengths. The original Watch Dogs felt as deep as a puddle once you noticed that many of the side or emergent encounters, like thefts, played out exactly the same every time.
While the scenarios arenât that different in Watch Dogs: Legion, these scenarios feel different because every character involved is a potential recruit, even the enemies. If you arenât a fan of Ubisoftâs focus on quantity over quality when it comes to open-world design, Watch Dogs: Legion doesnât do much to move the needle, but it doesnât really need to.
Even so, Watch Dogs: Legion has several obvious faults, mostly on a technical level. On the surface, many characters are just not worth recruiting over others. Because the game procedurally generates up to 9 million characters, many of those wind up being duds. 
For example, characters who give you a special vehicle without any additional capabilities feel useless when pretty much any vehicle around London can be hijacked with little consequence. While day-to-day schedules and bios for each character are also unique, dialogue with them can repeat entire conversations you've had word-for-word with someone else.
'Watch Dogs: Legion' has a motley assortment of potential recruits to choose from.
Conversations often feel stilted as a result, with voice actors awkwardly delivering lines that contain excessive British slang in simple exchanges that donât warrant it. This lack of depth causes the overall story to suffer as a result. At times that's okay. At others, it feels like underdelivering on a lofty promise.
Watch Dogs games never have the deepest stories or characters. Still, Legionâs staggering lineup of playable characters mostly takes a collective passive role in the gameâs broader narrative. It relies on its few non-playable characters, like DedSec leader Sabine, hacker Nowt, antagonist and Albion CEO Nigel Cass, and charming A.I. Bagley to give the story some depth and forward momentum. The results wind up feeling a bit mixed, and your recruits wind up feeling tertiary.
While characters like Bagley are consistently well-written and funny, others like Sabine and Nigel are shallow and only gain depth towards the end of their story arcs. Outside of a few moments that embrace wacky but scary sci-fi concepts â like transforming the human consciousness into artificial intelligence â none of its other story beats were that original or thrilling.   
Even the game's political message feels surprisingly tame despite the context surrounding an uprising in a post-Brexit London. This isnât a game you play for the story but rather one you play for the emergent scenarios that open up thanks to its systems and puzzle solutions.
Watch Dogs: Legion pushes current-gen hardware to its limits and suffers all the more for it.
Even after installing a day-one patch, Inverse still ran into extremely long load times, frequent texture pop-in, lots of hard crashes, and even some environmental glitches throughout our playthrough on an Xbox One S.
An example of the character profiling that is common in 'Watch Dogs' games.
Online play is also missing at launch despite being right on the menu. (It releases December 3.) This game clearly needs a lot more polish, so donât feel bad waiting until the next-generation consoles drop and that multiplayer update is out. If you want an open-world game that truly feels different from its peers, Watch Dogs: Legion does accomplish that and is still worth playing eventually.
The gameâs ambition clearly came at a cost, but the Watch Dogs series has finally found its unique voice with the Play as Anyone mechanic. The series can only get better and deeper from here; something like the death of Maciej feels even more unique and heartbreaking than it already is. 
7/10
Watch Dogs: Legion will be released for PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Google Stadia on October 29, 2020.

The IP6.nl Hall of Fame


            The Hall of Fame is a list of all domains that score 5 stars on
            this website. Qualifying domains are added to the Hall
            automatically, and then re-tested frequently.
            








            The following X domains are IPv6 ready:
            




            The outcome of the domain test is based solely on DNS and is
            therefore susceptible to caching.

        Please send your questions and comments to Juerd Waalboer <juerd@tnx.nl>.
    

When a domain does have IPv6 nameservers, but the IPv6-only test fails, it's
usually either because the IPv6 nameservers aren't actually reachable, or
because the glue
records are missing. In other words, the IPv6 addresses for the nameservers
are not yet registered with the domain registry.  Contact your domain name
registrar for instructions.


This website (or webapp, as some call it) was built to help raise awareness
about common configuration mistakes, and IPv6 in general. It caters to
customers who want to find out if their ISP is doing a good job, and to
network and system administrators who need reliable information to resolve
the issues.


The frontend was made with HTML5 and jQuery. It fetches JSON data from a PLP backend that is based on Perl, FastCGI, and lighttpd. The backend exists to 
provide a controlled environment for the DNS queries.


This website is meant purely as a testing tool; for information about IPv6,
please refer to your favorite search engine.


IPv6 is version 6 of the new Internet Protocol. Every networked device and every
internet application will need to support this. For now, most of the internet
is dual stacked: version 4 and 6 are used side-by-side and websites and other
internet services that are not yet IPv6 ready continue to function properly for the vast majority of users.


But the IPv4 address space is exhausted. They're all gone. Already many internet
users are connected through all kinds of tricks and workarounds. That works, but
it doesn't scale very well, in terms of bandwidth and the number of connected
devices. It is important that every web site starts accepting connections via
IPv6.


The protocol specification for IPv6 dates back to December 1998, but most
organisations have waited until the IPv4 pool was fully depleted. And now we
panic.


June 6th of 2012 is world wide "IPv6 Launch Day". Many large international
organizations will enable IPv6 during this day. But there is no technical
reason to wait for others. Why wait? Get IPv6 ready NOW!

                Hello visitor. There may be several reasons why you are here - maybe you are not familiar with the Bible and you
were just browsing through the internet and just accidentally bumped into this page, or maybe you opened
this page searching for truth. Maybe you are already familiar with the Bible and it is illegal in your country
to read or own a Bible and for that reason, this project is also available in various networks, like
Tor, I2P, Freenet, Zeronet, IPFS, Lokinet or Yggdrasil to provide uncensored access.
For whatever reason you opened this page, you are welcome here and I invite you to
feel free to start reading.


            

                If you are new to the Bible, I encourage you to start with the Gospel of John. It provides basic overview of who Jesus is and about His mission.
Few other books I recommend to read after the Gospel of John are Romans, Proverbs, Psalms or the book of Genesis.
Also, if you have any questions about the Bible, about the stuff you read or if you are missing translation in your language,
feel free to contact us. So, are you ready to begin?

                           Using Git over Tor can be achieved via Tor service or by using Tor Browser. Tor service runs by default on port 9050. The Tor browser (you already have) runs on port 9150.
                        
Alternatively, you can use Git over Tor by using the torify command! Which makes is very easy to use. Example:
                           
                             torify git ...
                           


                           Clone an existing Git repo when you're using the Tor service. Note: this is an example repo.
Important: If you are using the Tor Browser change the port below from 9050 to port 9150.

                           Type in terminal:
                           
                              git -c http.proxy=socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 clone http://it7otdanqu7ktntxzm427cba6i53w6wlanlh23v5i3siqmos47pzhvyd.onion/your_org/your_repo.git
                              cd your_repo 
                              git config --add remote.origin.proxy "socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050"
                           


                           Add an existing folder repository to Git using Tor. We'll use the Tor service in this example, running again on port 9050. Change port 9050 to 9150, when you're using the Tor Browser.

                           Type in terminal:
                           
                              cd your_repo
                              git remote add origin http://it7otdanqu7ktntxzm427cba6i53w6wlanlh23v5i3siqmos47pzhvyd.onion/your_org/your_repo.git
                              git config --add remote.origin.proxy "socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050"
                              git add .
                              git commit -m "Initial commit"
                              git push -u origin master
                           


                          Pushing an existing Git repository, is also possible. In that case rename origin, add the new origin (this example is using port 9050) and push it.

                           Type in terminal:
                           
                              cd your_repo
                              git remote rename origin old-origin
                              git remote add origin http://it7otdanqu7ktntxzm427cba6i53w6wlanlh23v5i3siqmos47pzhvyd.onion/your_org/your_repo.git
                              git config --add remote.origin.proxy "socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050"
                              git push -u origin --all
                              git push -u origin --tags

Dynamic scalable omni-channel robust dual-stacked operationalized mail solutions... for me! Jake!
"Please, JAKE! Give me a free email account so my emails won't be parsed by... er 'Roorle' and subsequently be served targeted ads!" Heh, NOPE!
"B-b-but J-j-j-j-Jake!!! I WANT an email address at YOUR service!"
Ok, okay, let's briefly talk about this email server. It is a VPS that I rent for $3.50 a month... Basically, this thing is not hosted at my house. IE I do not control it. Sure I handle the software on it but that is about it. For $3.50 a month I get a meager 10GB memory space and 512MB RAM. Kinda hideous. This is Raspberry Pi level of resource allocated to me... But that is not the worst of it! No no, imagine this: the police knows that I have a email server and they want a copy of EVERYTHING on it! Who do they send the subpoena to? Not me! They send it to my VPS provider. They have this 'snapshot' feature where they make a backup of your current state of your instance... so what they do is send a snapshot of my current server and the police can just look through there without me ever knowing. Nightmare tier. Also, my VPS provider can also give the police logs of all internet based activity that occur with this instance... they don't need me to provide logs! This is the future of cloud services. I'd be weary of VPS tor guards/relays/exits for this reason (not that you have a choice in what your nodes will be.)
"Then why are you using one?" This VPS provider has a needed rDNS option that my ISP is unwilling to give. Honestly, if the VPS gave a $1 dollar option with half of everything they give me WITH rDNS, I would pay for that.
"I still want an email at your service!" Read this.

A transit AS (Autonomous System) refers to an AS that is able to provide IP transit, i.e. it can receive packets from one peer and forward them on through another. In other words, a transit AS allows 'through' traffic, rather than just traffic explicitly destined for itself. It's a bit like the difference between a main road and a dead end on a road traffic network - a main road always leads somewhere else, while a dead end only leads to itself.
The most common example of transit AS's is large ISPs and transit providers, which each have multiple connections with a diverse range of networks, allowing for resilient routing and connectivity. However, any BGP setup that is multi-homed (i.e. has two or more unique peers) has the potential to become a transit AS, and this is by-design.
For example, if you are peering with two different upstream ISPs, but they don't have a direct connection between each other (or the connection is disrupted), the traffic might end up being routed through your network, as ultimately your network provides a valid path between the two ISPs.
If you are a network provider or ISP yourself, then this is most likely what you want to happen, as ultimately that's what your business is for. However, if you're simply wanting to announce the prefixes for your own network, it may be undesirable to become a transit AS, as your network resources and bandwidth may be used to handle traffic that is completely unrelated to your business operations. To use the road traffic network analogy again - it's like an emergency diversion routing traffic from a major road down a quiet back street and overloading it, much to the dismay of the residents!
This article will detail how you can configure your Quagga BGP daemon to prevent becoming a transit AS. Continue reading...

Tor is a fantastic networking and privacy technology that makes private and anonymous browsing available to millions. Despite this, it is unfortunately seen by some people as a system that solely exists to facilitate an illegal criminal underground, 
However, to take a literal view, Tor is just a networking tool, and it can be used in any way that you want. The features that enable privacy and anonymity are also extremely useful for many of the tasks carried out by Network Engineers and Systems Administrators on a daily basis. For example:
In this article, I will demonstrate how Tor can be used to carry out some of these tasks, and why using Tor may be advantageous to other methods. Continue reading...

Quagga is a network routing software suite providing implementations of various routing protocols, including RIP, OSPF and BGP. It is a fork of the discontinued GNU Zebra project, and utilises a configuration syntax very similar to that of Cisco IOS.
An 1804 illustration by Samuel Daniell of a South African quagga, an extinct subspecies of plains zebra after which the Quagga network routing software suite was named. Source (Public Domain)
Unlike traditional routing daemons which interact directly with the kernel, Quagga operates a central kernel routing manager (known as zebra) which exposes an API to the various Quagga routing daemons. This allows the routing daemons to be enabled, disabled and configured on a 'pick and mix' basis, including the ability to run multiple of the same routing daemon on one machine.
This article and series will be primarily focusing on Quagga BGPd, which is Quagga's BGP routing implementation. Continue reading...

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) provides a way to restrict the mail servers that are permitted to send as your domain, and is particularly effective when used with DMARC.
However, maintaining an SPF policy for a large or complex infrastructure with numerous distinct mail servers can pose a significant operational challenge. Some of the most common issues include:
SPF macros, a seldom used yet widely supported feature of the SPF specification, provide a potential solution to some of these challenges.
This article includes an introduction to SPF macros, as well as several examples of how they can be used to solve the various operational complications that SPF so often poses. Continue reading...

International sanctions since the Myanmar military's illegal attempted coup
Justice For Myanmar has compared targeted sanctions imposed by democracies on the illegal Myanmar junta, its businesses and those complicit in its crimes. Targeted sanctions are a crucial mechanism to stop the flow of funds, arms, equipment, technology and jet fuel to the junta and to take action against those responsible for human rights violations and corruption. 
We looked at the sanctions track records of Australia, Canada, theÂ EU, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the UK and USA since February 1, 2021.
Comparison of sanctions designations by country (updated February 1, 2024): Download Excel File 
â
Appallingly, since the Myanmar military's attempted coup, India, Japan and South Korea have not imposed any targeted sanctions.
Companies and governments from those countries are implicated in ongoing business with the military junta. 
For instance, the Japanese state-backed Y Complex project involves payments to the Myanmar Army's Office of the Quartermaster General, although payments have reportedly been suspended since February 1, 2021. 
The Shwe Gas project, which involves a collaboration between South Korea's state-owned company, KOGAS, POSCO International and the junta-controlled Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), bankrolls the junta. 
The majority state-owned Bharat Electronics Limited has repeatedly transferred equipment to the Myanmar military since its attempted coup. 
Business with the junta and its conglomerates enables its widening campaign of terror.
Through their inaction â at best â and complicity, at worst, India, Japan and South Korea are failing to uphold their human rights responsibilities and failing the people of Myanmar. We call on them to change direction and support democracy and human rights in Myanmar.
Since the militaryâs illegal coup attempt, Australia has only imposed two rounds of sanctions against seven entities and 16 members of the junta. Despite the significant involvement of Australian-owned and led companies in the mining sector, Australia has so far failed to sanction any junta-controlled agencies or key individuals involved in mining. 
While New Zealand acted swiftly to formally suspend high-level contact with the Myanmar military junta, it too has failed to follow this up with targeted sanctions, with the exception ofÂ travel bans imposed in 2021 and 2022 on a total of 21 people. This is insufficient. New Zealand does not have a Magnitsky law.
Rounds of sanctions have been imposed by the USA, UK, Canada, EU, Australia and New Zealand on some senior junta individuals, junta-controlled enterprises, arms brokers and cronies. Yet, sanctions have lacked coordination and have failed to cover whole networks of companies. Not nearly enough has been done to designate individuals and entities that continue to provide the junta with funds, arms, equipment, technology and jet fuel.
For instance, despite evidence that oil and gas bankrolls the military junta, enabling its continued atrocity crimes, only the EU has fully sanctioned MOGE, while the USA has prohibited financial services with it. MOGE is a state-owned enterprise illegally under Myanmar military control that is the junta's single biggest source of foreign revenue. 
Many key military-controlled businesses, their directors and associates have also yet to be sanctioned, despite their well-documented links to the Myanmar military's international crimes. 
A notable example is Telecom International Myanmar, the company that owns the Mytel mobile network that is not yet sanctioned in any jurisdiction. Mytel provides a lucrative source of revenue for the terrorist junta and supports the military's communications and surveillance capabilities. It is co-owned by the military conglomerate Myanmar Economic CorporationÂ (MEC), which is sanctioned by Australia, Canada, the EU, UKÂ and USA.
Few sanctions have been imposed on crony individuals and businesses that provides the military with funds. Notable exceptions include the UK and EUâs sanctions against International Group of Entrepreneur (IGE) and the USA and Canadaâs sanctions against Shwe Byain Phyu. 
Targeted sanctions are an important tool for the international community to deploy in support of the Myanmar people's rejection of the attempted coup and struggle to build a federal democracy. 
Justice For Myanmar continues to call for wide-ranging international action, including targeted sanctions and a global arms embargo.

Home
Welcome to your picosite demo, this is a working site with most features enabled. This serves to demonstrate picosite and what it can do. Firstly though, what is it for? This is for dark web vendors who wish to have a site which cannot be defaced, and advertise things like prices and contain things like GPG keys and even a canary.
It allows for much content to go on a site, and information on your products and services. One can use it on hosting like my own at Kaizushi's Little Onion Server where one gets a nice SSH shell, which can be used to configure cron. This demo site is also always available online.
If you are on the demosite now yourself you can go to its Github branch for the project.
To get the demosite running on your system or web hosting account one can use git.
The first step is to clone picosite...
$ git clone https://github.com/kaizushi/picosite
Then checkout the demosite branch...
$ git checkout demosite
You should check out the licence under which I release this software, which is called the MIT licence.
Once you have checked out the branch and such you need to install it to your web directory.
To configure your picosite you should read the readme file.
The prices on the offical demosite hosted on my servers are legit and what I will charge to install the software for you.
If you have problems with the software you should leave a post on the Github picosite repo issues page. You can also contact me at kaizushi at infantile dot us by email.

A little boy was killed after being electrocuted at a Blackpool hotel, a coroner has confirmed. 
Jack Piper-Sheach was with his family at Tiffany's Hotel on the Promenade at 10.39pm on the evening of Sunday, September 3, when he suffered serious injuries consistent with him having received a high voltage of electricity. The 10-year-old was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool but sadly died four days later with his family by his bedside.
A pre-inquest review was held today (February 27) at Blackpool Town Hall. Senior Coroner Alan Wilson revealed that Jack, from Grimsby, had been on holiday with his mum Kelly, his aunt Katie and her boyfriend, and his grandma at the time of the incident.

Other witnesses expected to give evidence at the final inquest, either in person or by way of a statement being read in court, include paramedics, a paediatric consultant at Blackpool and a consultant at Alder Hey who confirmed the cause of Jack's death was a hypoxic brain injury due to prolonged cardiac arrest due to electrocution injury. 
Eye-witness Karen Griffiths has also provided a statement to the coroner as well as several employees from Tiffany's Hotel. The hotel was closed for several weeks following Jack's death but has since re-opened. 
Tiffany's Hotel is owned by Y7 Hotels Ltd based in Blackpool. The company has two directors; Adam Johnstone, who attended today's review hearing, and David Johnstone. Both are also directors of Lakeside Retreats Ltd based at Cleveleymere Lakeside Lodges in Forton near Lancaster. 
The review heard that Cheltenham-based electrical firm Calbarrie undertook out an electrical installation condition report at Tiffany's Hotel in 2020 while E Dugdale Sons & Grandson Ltd, based in Blackpool, had also carried out work at the hotel. 
The hotel was represented by a barrister during the hearing while Jack's family was also represented. A health and safety officer from Blackpool Council and head of legal services were also in attendance. 
Expert evidence is also expected to be given at the final inquest with a date to be confirmed but likely to be held in the summer. The hearing, which won't be heard by a jury, is expected to last two days. 
In a GoFundMe set up after Jack's death, which raised more than Â£2,500, his aunt Katie wrote: "My nephew's life was sadly taken after being electrocuted whilst on holiday in Blackpool. It was an incident as a family we wasn't prepared for, we wasn't expecting to lose our little man at only 10 years old.
"Jack was the life and soul of our family, always laughing and giggling and putting a smile on our faces, he especially loved going to the seaside and having an ice cream, specifically; double cone vanilla ice cream with sprinkles blueberry sauce and a flake (never had anything else... maybe sometimes a single cone instead of a double much to his disappointment). 
"He didn't deserve to be taken so suddenly from us. Jack has been laid to rest in a beautiful private service, as a family we've covered those extra costs. 
"I'm now raising money on behalf of Kelly and Gary so they can give Jack the beautiful memorial headstone they dream of for their little boy, any extra donations will go towards supporting living expenses whilst they grieve and making sure Jack's love of adventure, fun and all things silly lives on."

                                Comparing mortgages isnât easy. Sometimes deals look attractive because they have a low initial rate, but you also need to take into account
                                any fees that come with the mortgage deal. We recommend annual cost as the best way to see which mortgage deal offers
                                the best value for the size of mortgage youâre looking to take.
                            

                                This is how we calculate the annual cost:
                            
 By comparing mortgage deals looking at annual cost you can see which one would be cheapest for you taking into account fees as well as the interest rate. The annual cost only applies to the initial deal as its always best to consider switching once the initial deal is over to see if you could save money.

                                The rate you will pay at the start of your mortgage.
                            

                                Your monthly payment when your mortgage starts, based on the loan amount you entered.

BGP Large Communities are a novel way to signal
        information between networks. Large BGP Communities are easy to use,
        implement and deploy.
        

        An example of Large Communities is:
        2914:65400:38016. Large BGP Communities
        are composed of three 4-byte integers, separated by a colon. This is
        easy to remember and accommodates advanced routing policies in
        relation to 4-Byte
            ASNs.
        
This website brings together implementers and end users of the
        Large BGP Communities.

RFC 8195 presents examples and
inspiration for the operational application of BGP Large Communities. The
document suggests logical categories of BGP Large Communities and demonstrates
an orderly manner of organizing community values within them to achieve typical
goals in routing policy. Any operator can consider using the concepts presented
as the basis for their own BGP Large Communities repertoire.

Last Call and IESG Review to adopt the specification.  The email below

attribute value, The IANA has assigned a new BGP Path Attribute value to Large
BGP Communities. LARGE_COMMUNITY is now thirty two - very fitting given the problem
that Large BGP Communities is solving :-)

Think you know DMARC? Prove it by taking our quiz. We'll ask you ten questions and give you more details about the correct answer. Taking the DMARC quiz is an excellent way to learn.
Want to analyze email headers? You can now paste your email headers/source to get a visual explanation of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC perfomance.

Hello Libera Chat users,
Itâs been a while since weâve made a blog post.
Weâve been quiet, but that doesnât mean we havenât been busy!
Over the past few months, weâve made a number of improvements
and weâre excited to highlight a few of them today.
A couple of these features have been available for a while,
but havenât been properly announced yet.
A channel with mode R prevents unidentified users from
sending messages to it but does not prevent them from joining.
It is a softer version of the existing channel mode r
and provides a more intuitive error message than q $~a.
If your channel quiets unidentified users or redirects them to another channel
for the sole purpose of telling them to identify,
we recommend using this mode instead.
Invite exemptions (channel mode I) now allow
unidentified users to join channels that
normally block them with channel mode r.
Some channels currently do not block unidentified users
because doing so would also block users they want to make exceptions for.
These exceptions can be users of a particular shared bouncer, Matrix users,
or even old regulars that do not want to have NickServ accounts.
With this change, exceptions can be made for those users. However,
invite exemptions deliberately do not apply to the new channel mode R.
TOPICPREPEND adds a section to the topic the same way TOPICAPPEND
does, except that it adds to the start of the topic instead of the end.
This can be useful when one wants to keep most of the topic,
but draw attention to an important matter.
TOPICSWAP finds and replaces text in a topic. For example,
letâs say thereâs a channel topic that contains
All-day voice chat on 29 Oct 2022
and that the community voice chat needs to be delayed a week.
Someone with the t flag in that channelâs ChanServ FLAGS list
can use the command /msg ChanServ TOPICSWAP <channel> 29 Oct 2022:5 Nov 2022
to change it. Afterwards, that part of the topic can be deleted using
/msg ChanServ TOPICSWAP <channel> All-day voice chat on 5 Nov 2022:.
ChanServ no longer displays users with the b flag  in the FLAGS list.
The b flag indicates that the target should be
automatically kicked and banned from the channel,
and is often set using the ChanServ AKICK command.
As a result, channels that make heavy use of AKICK
now have easier-to-navigate access lists.
You can still view the AKICK entries
with /msg ChanServ AKICK <channel> LIST.
We wanted to get this post out quickly,
so there are a few new features that arenât quite ready yet.
They are actively being worked on,
and we will try to have them available soon.
SaslServ sends users alerts
when there is a failure to log in to their accounts.
We have found that these alerts indicate that someone has
a misconfigured client more often than they indicate
actual malicious attempts to log in,
and if they do indicate a malicious attempt to log in,
thereâs usually nothing a normal user can do other than change their password.
For users with common nicknames â who commonly have to deal with
misconfigured clients attempting to log into their accounts â
these alerts do nothing more than spam and worry them.
Actual brute-force login attempts are fairly rare on the network,
and we have (recently-upgraded) automated countermeasures against them.
We are going to be allowing these messages to be toggled.
Sometime near the start of next month (Nov 2022),
you will be able to change whether or not you receive an alert on
every failed login attempt.
To do so, you would use the command
/msg NickServ SET BADPASSWDMSG <ON|OFF>.
We are currently having a discussion about whether or not
the new BADPASSWDMSG account setting should be ON or OFF by default.
There will be a staff vote at the end of the month,
and in the meantime we will be listening for arguments in support
of one or the other. Regardless of the decision,
you will be able to change this setting for your own account.
Our account verification emails will soon include links that
new users can go to in order to verify their accounts,
instead of having to use the NickServ VERIFY command.
The current method of account verification will still work.
We are also working on a web form to allow new users to
create new accounts without ever having to /msg NickServ.
If other users knowing how long youâve been idle for is a privacy concern,
user mode I will allow you to hide that information from /whois queries.
There are still a few more specifics to discuss before we enable this,
but the hope is to offer this feature before the end of the year.
This one is farther off, but we are looking into implementing
token-based authentication for user accounts. The intent is to
provide a method of authentication that is more convenient
than CertFP or a cryptographic challenge, but is still secure-by-default.
We plan to allow token-based authentication to be done over SASL PLAIN
so that existing clients can use it.
We will also allow this form of authentication for Tor users,
while keeping password-based authentication restricted.
There are still a lot of questions we need to answer
before we can even start to implement this. Ideally, we would also like to
have a SASL mechanism for doing token-based authentication only,
which we would work with client authors to implement.
We have some very exciting projects that are still early in development.
We hope to be able to share more details about them next year.
Sneak peeks of some of what weâre working on can be found on
our Github.
Watch this space,
our mastodon,
and twitter for future updates.

Alors que la France tente depuis un an dâadapter son dispositif militaire en Afrique face aux contestations croissantes, un collectif dâorganisations et de personnalitÃ©s plaide pour un Â«agenda de retrait militaire totalÂ».
Alors que le projet de loi sur lâinscription du droit Ã  lâavortement dans la Constitution sera dÃ©battu au SÃ©nat mercredi, cinq structures demandent lâannulation dâun dÃ©cret qui complique les IVG instrumentales par des sages-femmes.

This document contains the LLVM Developer Policy which defines the projectâs
policy towards developers and their contributions. The intent of this policy is
to eliminate miscommunication, rework, and confusion that might arise from the
distributed nature of LLVMâs development.  By stating the policy in clear terms,
we hope each developer can know ahead of time what to expect when making LLVM
contributions.  This policy covers all llvm.org subprojects, including Clang,
LLDB, libc++, etc.
This policy is also designed to accomplish the following objectives:
Attract both users and developers to the LLVM project.
Make life as simple and easy for contributors as possible.
Keep the top of tree as stable as possible.
Establish awareness of the projectâs copyright, license, and patent
policies with contributors to the project.
This policy is aimed at frequent contributors to LLVM. People interested in
contributing one-off patches can do so in an informal way by sending them to the
llvm-commits mailing list and engaging another
developer to see it through the process.
This section contains policies that pertain to frequent LLVM developers.  We
always welcome one-off patches from people who do not routinely contribute to
LLVM, but we expect more from frequent contributors to keep the system as
efficient as possible for everyone.  Frequent LLVM contributors are expected to
meet the following requirements in order for LLVM to maintain a high standard of
quality.
Developers should stay informed by reading the LLVM Discourse forums and subscribing
to the categories of interest for notifications.
Paying attention to changes being made by others is a good way to see what other people
are interested in and watching the flow of the project as a whole.
Contibutions to the project are made through GitHub Pull Requests.
You can subscribe to notification for areas of the codebase by joining
one of the pr-subscribers-*
GitHub teams. This mapping
indicates which team is associated with a particular paths in the repository.
You can also subscribe to the âcommitsâ mailing list for a subproject youâre interested in,
such as llvm-commits, cfe-commits, or lldb-commits.
Missing features and bugs are tracked through our GitHub issue tracker
and assigned labels. We recommend that active developers monitor incoming issues.
You can subscribe for notification for specific components by joining
one of the issue-subscribers-*
teams.
You may also subscribe to the llvm-bugs email list to keep track
of bugs and enhancements occurring in the entire project.  We really appreciate people
who are proactive at catching incoming bugs in their components and dealing with them
promptly.
Please be aware that all public LLVM mailing lists and discourse forums are public and archived, and
that notices of confidentiality or non-disclosure cannot be respected.
When making a patch for review, the goal is to make it as easy for the reviewer
to read it as possible.  As such, we recommend that you:
Make your patch against git main, not a branch, and not an old version
of LLVM.  This makes it easy to apply the patch.  For information on how to
clone from git, please see the Getting Started Guide.
Similarly, patches should be submitted soon after they are generated.  Old
patches may not apply correctly if the underlying code changes between the
time the patch was created and the time it is applied.
Once you have created your patch, create a
GitHub Pull Request for
it (or commit it directly if applicable).
When submitting patches, please do not add confidentiality or non-disclosure
notices to the patches themselves.  These notices conflict with the LLVM
licensing terms and may result in your contribution being excluded.
LLVM has a code-review policy. Code review is one way to increase the quality of
software. Please see LLVM Code-Review Policy and Practices for more information on LLVMâs code-review
process.
Please help notify users and vendors of potential disruptions when upgrading to
a newer version of a tool. For example, deprecating a feature that is expected
to be removed in the future, removing an already-deprecated feature, upgrading a
diagnostic from a warning to an error, switching important default behavior, or
any other potentially disruptive situation thought to be worth raising
awareness of. For such changes, the following should be done:
Warning
Phabricator is deprecated and will be switched to read-only mode in October
2023, for new code contributions use GitHub Pull Requests.
This section contains old information that needs to be updated.
When performing the code review for the change, please add any applicable
âvendorsâ group to the review for their awareness. The purpose of these
groups is to give vendors early notice that potentially disruptive changes
are being considered but have not yet been accepted. Vendors can give early
testing feedback on the changes to alert us to unacceptable breakages. The
current list of vendor groups is:
Clang vendors
libc++ vendors
People interested in joining the vendors group can do so by clicking the
âJoin Projectâ link on the vendorâs âMembersâ page in Phabricator.
When committing the change to the repository, add appropriate information
about the potentially breaking changes to the Potentially Breaking Changes
section of the projectâs release notes. The release note should have
information about what the change is, what is potentially disruptive about
it, as well as any code examples, links, and motivation that is appropriate
to share with users. This helps users to learn about potential issues with
upgrading to that release.
After the change has been committed to the repository, the potentially
disruptive changes described in the release notes should be posted to the
Announcements channel on
Discourse. The post should be tagged with the potentially-breaking label
and a label specific to the project (such as clang, llvm, etc). This
is another mechanism by which we can give pre-release notice to users about
potentially disruptive changes. It is a lower-traffic alternative to the
joining âvendorsâ group. To automatically be notified of new announcements
with the potentially-breaking label, go to your user preferences page in
Discourse, and add the label to one of the watch categories under
Notifications->Tags.
The LLVM Project relies on two features of its process to maintain rapid
development in addition to the high quality of its source base: the combination
of code review plus post-commit review for trusted maintainers.  Having both is
a great way for the project to take advantage of the fact that most people do
the right thing most of the time, and only commit patches without pre-commit
review when they are confident they are right.
The trick to this is that the project has to guarantee that all patches that are
committed are reviewed after they go in: you donât want everyone to assume
someone else will review it, allowing the patch to go unreviewed.  To solve this
problem, we have a notion of an âownerâ for a piece of the code.  The sole
responsibility of a code owner is to ensure that a commit to their area of the
code is appropriately reviewed, either by themself or by someone else.  The list
of current code owners can be found in the file CODE_OWNERS.TXT in the
root of the LLVM source tree.
Note that code ownership is completely different than reviewers: anyone can
review a piece of code, and we welcome code review from anyone who is
interested.  Code owners are the âlast line of defenseâ to guarantee that all
patches that are committed are actually reviewed.
Being a code owner is a somewhat unglamorous position, but it is incredibly
important for the ongoing success of the project.  Because people get busy,
interests change, and unexpected things happen, code ownership is purely opt-in,
and anyone can choose to resign their âtitleâ at any time. For now, we do not
have an official policy on how one gets elected to be a code owner.
Developers are required to create test cases for any bugs fixed and any new
features added.  Some tips for getting your testcase approved:
All feature and regression test cases are added to the llvm/test
directory. The appropriate sub-directory should be selected (see the
Testing Guide for details).
Test cases should be written in LLVM assembly language.
Test cases, especially for regressions, should be reduced as much as possible,
by bugpoint or manually. It is unacceptable to place an
entire failing program into llvm/test as this creates a time-to-test
burden on all developers. Please keep them short.
Avoid adding links to resources that are not available to the entire
community, such as links to private bug trackers, internal corporate
documentation, etc. Instead, add sufficient comments to the test to provide
the context behind such links.
Note that llvm/test and clang/test are designed for regression and small feature
tests only. More extensive test cases (e.g., entire applications, benchmarks,
etc) should be added to the llvm-test test suite.  The llvm-test suite is
for coverage (correctness, performance, etc) testing, not feature or regression
testing.
Many projects in LLVM communicate important changes to users through release
notes, typically found in docs/ReleaseNotes.rst for the project. Changes to
a project that are user-facing, or that users may wish to know about, should be
added to the projectâs release notes at the authorâs or code reviewerâs
discretion, preferably as part of the commit landing the changes. Examples of
changes that would typically warrant adding a release note (this list is not
exhaustive):
Adding, removing, or modifying command-line options.
Adding, removing, or regrouping a diagnostic.
Fixing a bug that potentially has significant user-facing impact (please link
to the issue fixed in the bug database).
Adding or removing optimizations that have widespread impact or enables new
programming paradigms.
Modifying a C stable API.
Notifying users about a potentially disruptive change expected to be made in
a future release, such as removal of a deprecated feature. In this case, the
release note should be added to a Potentially Breaking Changes section of
the notes with sufficient information and examples to demonstrate the
potential disruption. Additionally, any new entries to this section should be
announced in the Announcements
channel on Discourse. See Making Potentially Breaking Changes for more details.
Code reviewers are encouraged to request a release note if they think one is
warranted when performing a code review.
The minimum quality standards that any change must satisfy before being
committed to the main development branch are:
Code must adhere to the LLVM Coding Standards.
Code must compile cleanly (no errors, no warnings) on at least one platform.
Bug fixes and new features should include a testcase so we know if the
fix/feature ever regresses in the future.
Code must pass the llvm/test test suite.
The code must not cause regressions on a reasonable subset of llvm-test,
where âreasonableâ depends on the contributorâs judgement and the scope of
the change (more invasive changes require more testing). A reasonable subset
might be something like âllvm-test/MultiSource/Benchmarksâ.
Ensure that links in source code and test files point to publicly available
resources and are used primarily to add additional information rather than
to supply critical context. The surrounding comments should be sufficient
to provide the context behind such links.
Additionally, the committer is responsible for addressing any problems found in
the future that the change is responsible for.  For example:
The code should compile cleanly on all supported platforms.
The changes should not cause any correctness regressions in the llvm-test
suite and must not cause any major performance regressions.
The change set should not cause performance or correctness regressions for the
LLVM tools.
The changes should not cause performance or correctness regressions in code
compiled by LLVM on all applicable targets.
You are expected to address any GitHub Issues that
result from your change.
We prefer for this to be handled before submission but understand that it isnât
possible to test all of this for every submission.  Our build bots and nightly
testing infrastructure normally finds these problems.  A good rule of thumb is
to check the nightly testers for regressions the day after your change.  Build
bots will directly email you if a group of commits that included yours caused a
failure.  You are expected to check the build bot messages to see if they are
your fault and, if so, fix the breakage.
Commits that violate these quality standards (e.g. are very broken) may be
reverted. This is necessary when the change blocks other developers from making
progress. The developer is welcome to re-commit the change after the problem has
been fixed.
Although we donât enforce the format of commit messages, we prefer that
you follow these guidelines to help review, search in logs, email formatting
and so on. These guidelines are very similar to rules used by other open source
projects.
Most importantly, the contents of the message should be carefully written to
convey the rationale of the change (without delving too much in detail). It
also should avoid being vague or overly specific. For example, âbits were not
set rightâ will leave the reviewer wondering about which bits, and why they
werenât right, while âCorrectly set overflow bits in TargetInfoâ conveys almost
all there is to the change.
Below are some guidelines about the format of the message itself:
Separate the commit message into title and body separated by a blank line.
If youâre not the original author, ensure the âAuthorâ property of the commit is
set to the original author and the âCommitterâ property is set to yourself.
You can use a command similar to
git commit --amend --author="John Doe <jdoe@llvm.org>" to correct the
author property if it is incorrect. See Attribution of Changes for more
information including the method we used for attribution before the project
migrated to git.
In the rare situation where there are multiple authors, please use the git
tag âCo-authored-by:â to list the additional authors.
The title should be concise. Because all commits are emailed to the list with
the first line as the subject, long titles are frowned upon.  Short titles
also look better in git log.
When the changes are restricted to a specific part of the code (e.g. a
back-end or optimization pass), it is customary to add a tag to the
beginning of the line in square brackets.  For example, â[SCEV] â¦â
or â[OpenMP] â¦â. This helps email filters and searches for post-commit
reviews.
The body, if it exists, should be separated from the title by an empty line.
The body should be concise, but explanatory, including a complete
reasoning.  Unless it is required to understand the change, examples,
code snippets and gory details should be left to bug comments, web
review or the mailing list.
Text formatting and spelling should follow the same rules as documentation
and in-code comments, ex. capitalization, full stop, etc.
If the commit is a bug fix on top of another recently committed patch, or a
revert or reapply of a patch, include the git commit hash of the prior
related commit. This could be as simple as âRevert commit NNNN because it
caused PR#â.
If the patch has been reviewed, add a link to its review page, as shown
here.
If the patch fixes a bug in GitHub Issues, we encourage adding a reference to
the issue being closed, as described
here.
It is also acceptable to add other metadata to the commit message to automate
processes, including for downstream consumers. This metadata can include
links to resources that are not available to the entire community. However,
such links and/or metadata should not be used in place of making the commit
message self-explanatory. Note that such non-public links should not be
included in the submitted code.
For minor violations of these recommendations, the community normally favors
reminding the contributor of this policy over reverting. Minor corrections and
omissions can be handled by sending a reply to the commits mailing list.
As a community, we strongly value having the tip of tree in a good state while
allowing rapid iterative development.  As such, we tend to make much heavier
use of reverts to keep the tree healthy than some other open source projects,
and our norms are a bit different.
How should you respond if someone reverted your change?
Remember, it is normal and healthy to have patches reverted.  Having a patch
reverted does not necessarily mean you did anything wrong.
We encourage explicitly thanking the person who reverted the patch for doing
the task on your behalf.
If you need more information to address the problem, please follow up in the
original commit thread with the reverting patch author.
When should you revert your own change?
Any time you learn of a serious problem with a change, you should revert it.
We strongly encourage ârevert to greenâ as opposed to âfixing forwardâ.  We
encourage reverting first, investigating offline, and then reapplying the
fixed patch - possibly after another round of review if warranted.
If you break a buildbot in a way which canât be quickly fixed, please revert.
If a test case that demonstrates a problem is reported in the commit thread,
please revert and investigate offline.
If you receive substantial post-commit review
feedback, please revert and address said feedback before recommitting.
(Possibly after another round of review.)
If you are asked to revert by another contributor, please revert and discuss
the merits of the request offline (unless doing so would further destabilize
tip of tree).
When should you revert someone elseâs change?
In general, if the author themselves would revert the change per these
guidelines, we encourage other contributors to do so as a courtesy to the
author.  This is one of the major cases where our norms differ from others;
we generally consider reverting a normal part of development.  We donât
expect contributors to be always available, and the assurance that a
problematic patch will be reverted and we can return to it at our next
opportunity enables this.
What are the expectations around a revert?
Use your best judgment. If youâre uncertain, please start an email on
the commit thread asking for assistance.  We arenât trying to enumerate
every case, but rather give a set of guidelines.
You should be sure that reverting the change improves the stability of tip
of tree.  Sometimes reverting one change in a series can worsen things
instead of improving them.  We expect reasonable judgment to ensure that
the proper patch or set of patches is being reverted.
The commit message for the reverting commit should explain why patch
is being reverted.
It is customary to respond to the original commit email mentioning the
revert.  This serves as both a notice to the original author that their
patch was reverted, and helps others following llvm-commits track context.
Ideally, you should have a publicly reproducible test case ready to share.
Where possible, we encourage sharing of test cases in commit threads, or
in PRs.  We encourage the reverter to minimize the test case and to prune
dependencies where practical.  This even applies when reverting your own
patch; documenting the reasons for others who might be following along
is critical.
It is not considered reasonable to revert without at least the promise to
provide a means for the patch author to debug the root issue.  If a situation
arises where a public reproducer can not be shared for some reason (e.g.
requires hardware patch author doesnât have access to, sharp regression in
compile time of internal workload, etc.), the reverter is expected to be
proactive about working with the patch author to debug and test candidate
patches.
Reverts should be reasonably timely.  A change submitted two hours ago
can be reverted without prior discussion.  A change submitted two years ago
should not be.  Where exactly the transition point is is hard to say, but
itâs probably in the handful of days in tree territory.  If you are unsure,
we encourage you to reply to the commit thread, give the author a bit to
respond, and then proceed with the revert if the author doesnât seem to be
actively responding.
When re-applying a reverted patch, the commit message should be updated to
indicate the problem that was addressed and how it was addressed.
We grant commit access to contributors with a track record of submitting high
quality patches.  If you would like commit access, please send an email to
Chris with your GitHub username.  This is true
for former contributors with SVN access as well as new contributors. If
approved, a GitHub invitation will be sent to your GitHub account. In case you
donât get notification from GitHub, go to
Invitation Link directly. Once
accept the invitation, youâll get commit access.
Prior to obtaining commit access, it is common practice to request that
someone with commit access commits on your behalf. When doing so, please
provide the name and email address you would like to use in the Author
property of the commit.
For external tracking purposes, committed changes are automatically reflected
on a commits mailing list soon after the commit lands (e.g. llvm-commits).
Note that these mailing lists are moderated, and it is not unusual for a large
commit to require a moderator to approve the email, so do not be concerned if a
commit does not immediately appear in the archives.
If you have recently been granted commit access, these policies apply:
You are granted commit-after-approval to all parts of LLVM. For
information on how to get approval for a patch, please see LLVM Code-Review Policy and Practices.
When approved, you may commit it yourself.
You are allowed to commit patches without approval which you think are
obvious. This is clearly a subjective decision â we simply expect you to
use good judgement.  Examples include: fixing build breakage, reverting
obviously broken patches, documentation/comment changes, any other minor
changes. Avoid committing formatting- or whitespace-only changes outside of
code you plan to make subsequent changes to. Also, try to separate
formatting or whitespace changes from functional changes, either by
correcting the format first (ideally) or afterward. Such changes should be
highly localized and the commit message should clearly state that the commit
is not intended to change functionality, usually by stating it is
NFC.
You are allowed to commit patches without approval to those portions of LLVM
that you have contributed or maintain (i.e., have been assigned
responsibility for), with the proviso that such commits must not break the
build.  This is a âtrust but verifyâ policy, and commits of this nature are
reviewed after they are committed.
Multiple violations of these policies or a single egregious violation may
cause commit access to be revoked.
In any case, your changes are still subject to code review (either before or
after they are committed, depending on the nature of the change).  You are
encouraged to review other peoplesâ patches as well, but you arenât required
to do so.
When a developer begins a major new project with the aim of contributing it back
to LLVM, they should inform the community with a post to the LLVM Discourse forums, to the extent
possible. The reason for this is to:
keep the community informed about future changes to LLVM,
avoid duplication of effort by preventing multiple parties working on the
same thing and not knowing about it, and
ensure that any technical issues around the proposed work are discussed and
resolved before any significant work is done.
The design of LLVM is carefully controlled to ensure that all the pieces fit
together well and are as consistent as possible. If you plan to make a major
change to the way LLVM works or want to add a major new extension, it is a good
idea to get consensus with the development community before you start working on
it.
Once the design of the new feature is finalized, the work itself should be done
as a series of incremental changes, not as a long-term development branch.
In the LLVM project, we do all significant changes as a series of incremental
patches.  We have a strong dislike for huge changes or long-term development
branches.  Long-term development branches have a number of drawbacks:
Branches must have mainline merged into them periodically.  If the branch
development and mainline development occur in the same pieces of code,
resolving merge conflicts can take a lot of time.
Other people in the community tend to ignore work on branches.
Huge changes (produced when a branch is merged back onto mainline) are
extremely difficult to code review.
Branches are not routinely tested by our nightly tester infrastructure.
Changes developed as monolithic large changes often donât work until the
entire set of changes is done.  Breaking it down into a set of smaller
changes increases the odds that any of the work will be committed to the main
repository.
To address these problems, LLVM uses an incremental development style and we
require contributors to follow this practice when making a large/invasive
change.  Some tips:
Large/invasive changes usually have a number of secondary changes that are
required before the big change can be made (e.g. API cleanup, etc).  These
sorts of changes can often be done before the major change is done,
independently of that work.
The remaining inter-related work should be decomposed into unrelated sets of
changes if possible.  Once this is done, define the first increment and get
consensus on what the end goal of the change is.
Each change in the set can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a
planned series of changes that works towards the development goal.
Each change should be kept as small as possible. This simplifies your work
(into a logical progression), simplifies code review and reduces the chance
that you will get negative feedback on the change. Small increments also
facilitate the maintenance of a high quality code base.
Often, an independent precursor to a big change is to add a new API and slowly
migrate clients to use the new API.  Each change to use the new API is often
âobviousâ and can be committed without review.  Once the new API is in place
and used, it is much easier to replace the underlying implementation of the
API.  This implementation change is logically separate from the API
change.
If you are interested in making a large change, and this scares you, please make
sure to first discuss the change/gather consensus then ask about the best way
to go about making the change.
When contributors submit a patch to an LLVM project, other developers with
commit access may commit it for the author once appropriate (based on the
progression of code review, etc.). When doing so, it is important to retain
correct attribution of contributions to their contributors. However, we do not
want the source code to be littered with random attributions âthis code written
by J. Random Hackerâ (this is noisy and distracting). In practice, the revision
control system keeps a perfect history of who changed what, and the CREDITS.txt
file describes higher-level contributions. If you commit a patch for someone
else, please follow the attribution of changes in the simple manner as outlined
by the commit messages section. Overall, please do not add contributor names
to the source code.
Also, donât commit patches authored by others unless they have submitted the
patch to the project or you have been authorized to submit them on their behalf
(you work together and your company authorized you to contribute the patches,
etc.). The author should first submit them to the relevant projectâs commit
list, development list, or LLVM bug tracker component. If someone sends you
a patch privately, encourage them to submit it to the appropriate list first.
Our previous version control system (subversion) did not distinguish between the
author and the committer like git does. As such, older commits used a different
attribution mechanism. The previous method was to include âPatch by John Doe.â
in a separate line of the commit message and there are automated processes that
rely on this format.
The goal of a ban is to protect people in the community from having to interact
with people who are consistently not respecting the
LLVM Community Code of Conduct in LLVM project spaces. Contributions of
any variety (pull requests, issue reports, forum posts, etc.) require
interacting with the community. Therefore, we do not accept any form of direct
contribution from a banned individual.
Indirect contributions are permissible only by someone taking full ownership of
such a contribution and they are responsible for all related interactions with
the community regarding that contribution.
When in doubt how to act in a specific instance, please reach out to
conduct@llvm.org for advice.
When the IR format has to be changed, keep in mind that we try to maintain some
backwards compatibility. The rules are intended as a balance between convenience
for llvm users and not imposing a big burden on llvm developers:
The textual format is not backwards compatible. We donât change it too often,
but there are no specific promises.
Additions and changes to the IR should be reflected in
test/Bitcode/compatibility.ll.
The current LLVM version supports loading any bitcode since version 3.0.
After each X.Y release, compatibility.ll must be copied to
compatibility-X.Y.ll. The corresponding bitcode file should be assembled
using the X.Y build and committed as compatibility-X.Y.ll.bc.
Newer releases can ignore features from older releases, but they cannot
miscompile them. For example, if nsw is ever replaced with something else,
dropping it would be a valid way to upgrade the IR.
Debug metadata is special in that it is currently dropped during upgrades.
Non-debug metadata is defined to be safe to drop, so a valid way to upgrade
it is to drop it. That is not very user friendly and a bit more effort is
expected, but no promises are made.
Stability Guarantees: The C API is, in general, a âbest effortâ for stability.
This means that we make every attempt to keep the C API stable, but that
stability will be limited by the abstractness of the interface and the
stability of the C++ API that it wraps. In practice, this means that things
like âcreate debug infoâ or âcreate this type of instructionâ are likely to be
less stable than âtake this IR file and JIT it for my current machineâ.
Release stability: We wonât break the C API on the release branch with patches
that go on that branch, with the exception that we will fix an unintentional
C API break that will keep the release consistent with both the previous and
next release.
Testing: Patches to the C API are expected to come with tests just like any
other patch.
Including new things into the API: If an LLVM subcomponent has a C API already
included, then expanding that C API is acceptable. Adding C API for
subcomponents that donât currently have one needs to be discussed on the
LLVM Discourse forums for design and maintainability feedback prior to implementation.
Documentation: Any changes to the C API are required to be documented in the
release notes so that itâs clear to external users who do not follow the
project how the C API is changing and evolving.
We intend to require newer toolchains as time goes by. This means LLVMâs
codebase can use newer versions of C++ as they get standardized. Requiring newer
toolchains to build LLVM can be painful for those building LLVM; therefore, it
will only be done through the following process:
It is a general goal to support LLVM and GCC versions from the last 3 years
at a minimum. This time-based guideline is not strict: we may support much
older compilers, or decide to support fewer versions.
An RFC is sent to the LLVM Discourse forums
Detail upsides of the version increase (e.g. which newer C++ language or
library features LLVM should use; avoid miscompiles in particular compiler
versions, etc).
Detail downsides on important platforms (e.g. Ubuntu LTS status).
Once the RFC reaches consensus, update the CMake toolchain version checks as
well as the getting started guide.  This provides a
softer transition path for developers compiling LLVM, because the
error can be turned into a warning using a CMake flag. This is an important
step: LLVM still doesnât have code which requires the new toolchains, but it
soon will. If you compile LLVM but donât read the forums, we should
tell you!
Ensure that at least one LLVM release has had this soft-error. Not all
developers compile LLVM top-of-tree. These release-bound developers should
also be told about upcoming changes.
Turn the soft-error into a hard-error after said LLVM release has branched.
Update the coding standards to allow the new
features weâve explicitly approved in the RFC.
Start using the new features in LLVMâs codebase.
Hereâs a sample RFC and the
corresponding change.
The main continuous integration (CI) tool for the LLVM project is the
LLVM Buildbot. It uses different builders
to cover a wide variety of sub-projects and configurations. The builds are
executed on different workers. Builders and workers are configured and
provided by community members.
The Buildbot tracks the commits on the main branch and the release branches.
This means that patches are built and tested after they are merged to the these
branches (aka post-merge testing). This also means itâs okay to break the build
occasionally, as itâs unreasonable to expect contributors to build and test
their patch with every possible configuration.
If your commit broke the build:
Fix the build as soon as possible as this might block other contributors or
downstream users.
If you need more time to analyze and fix the bug, please revert your change to
unblock others.
If someone else broke the build and this blocks your work
Comment on the code review in GitHub
(if available) or email the author, explain the problem and how this impacts
you. Add a link to the broken build and the error message so folks can
understand the problem.
Revert the commit if this blocks your work, see revert_policy .
If a build/worker is permanently broken
1st step: contact the owner of the worker. You can find the name and contact
information for the Admin of worker on the page of the build in the
Worker tab:
2nd step: If the owner does not respond or fix the worker, please escalate
to Galina Kostanova, the maintainer of the BuildBot master.
3rd step: If Galina could not help you, please escalate to the
Infrastructure Working Group.
The LLVM community is a vibrant and exciting place to be, and we look to be
inclusive of new projects and foster new communities, and increase
collaboration across industry and academia.
That said, we need to strike a balance between being inclusive of new ideas and
people and the cost of ongoing maintenance that new code requires.  As such, we
have a general support policy for introducing major new
components into the LLVM world, depending on the degree of detail and
responsibility required. Core projects need a higher degree of scrutiny
than peripheral projects, and the latter may have additional differences.
However, this is really only intended to cover common cases
that we have seen arise: different situations are different, and we are open
to discussing unusual cases as well - just start an RFC thread on the
LLVM Discourse forums.
LLVM is very receptive to new targets, even experimental ones, but a number of
problems can appear when adding new large portions of code, and back-ends are
normally added in bulk. New targets need the same level of support as other
core parts of the compiler, so they are covered in the core tier of our
support policy.
We have found that landing large pieces of new code and then trying to fix
emergent problems in-tree is problematic for a variety of reasons. For these
reasons, new targets are always added as experimental until they can be
proven stable, and later moved to non-experimental.
The differences between both classes are:
Experimental targets are not built by default (they need to be explicitly
enabled at CMake time).
Test failures, bugs, and build breakages that only appear when the
experimental target is enabled, caused by changes unrelated to the target, are
the responsibility of the community behind the target to fix.
The basic rules for a back-end to be upstreamed in experimental mode are:
Every target must have a code owner. The CODE_OWNERS.TXT
file has to be updated as part of the first merge. The code owner makes sure
that changes to the target get reviewed and steers the overall effort.
There must be an active community behind the target. This community
will help maintain the target by providing buildbots, fixing
bugs, answering the LLVM communityâs questions and making sure the new
target doesnât break any of the other targets, or generic code. This
behavior is expected to continue throughout the lifetime of the
targetâs code.
The code must be free of contentious issues, for example, large
changes in how the IR behaves or should be formed by the front-ends,
unless agreed by the majority of the community via refactoring of the
(IR standard) before the merge of the new target changes,
following the IR Backwards Compatibility.
The code conforms to all of the policies laid out in this developer policy
document, including license, patent, and coding standards.
The target should have either reasonable documentation on how it
works (ISA, ABI, etc.) or a publicly available simulator/hardware
(either free or cheap enough) - preferably both.  This allows
developers to validate assumptions, understand constraints and review code
that can affect the target.
In addition, the rules for a back-end to be promoted to official are:
The target must have addressed every other minimum requirement and
have been stable in tree for at least 3 months. This cool down
period is to make sure that the back-end and the target community can
endure continuous upstream development for the foreseeable future.
The targetâs code must have been completely adapted to this policy
as well as the coding standards. Any exceptions that
were made to move into experimental mode must have been fixed before
becoming official.
The test coverage needs to be broad and well written (small tests,
well documented). The build target check-all must pass with the
new target built, and where applicable, the test-suite must also
pass without errors, in at least one configuration (publicly
demonstrated, for example, via buildbots).
Public buildbots need to be created and actively maintained, unless
the target requires no additional buildbots (ex. check-all covers
all tests). The more relevant and public the new targetâs CI infrastructure
is, the more the LLVM community will embrace it.
To continue as a supported and official target:
The maintainer(s) must continue following these rules throughout the lifetime
of the target. Continuous violations of aforementioned rules and policies
could lead to complete removal of the target from the code base.
Degradation in support, documentation or test coverage will make the target as
nuisance to other targets and be considered a candidate for deprecation and
ultimately removed.
In essence, these rules are necessary for targets to gain and retain their
status, but also markers to define bit-rot, and will be used to clean up the
tree from unmaintained targets.
Those wishing to add a new target to LLVM must follow the procedure below:
Read this section and make sure your target follows all requirements. For
minor issues, your community will be responsible for making all necessary
adjustments soon after the initial merge.
Send a request for comment (RFC) to the LLVM Discourse forums describing
your target and how it follows all the requirements and what work has been
done and will need to be done to accommodate the official target requirements.
Make sure to expose any and all controversial issues, changes needed in the
base code, table gen, etc.
Once the response is positive, the LLVM community can start reviewing the
actual patches (but they can be prepared before, to support the RFC). Create
a sequence of N patches, numbered â1/Nâ to âN/Nâ (make sure N is an actual
number, not the letter âNâ), that completes the basic structure of the target.
The initial patch should add documentation, code owners and triple support in
clang and LLVM. The following patches add TableGen infrastructure to describe
the target and lower instructions to assembly. The final patch must show that
the target can lower correctly with extensive LIT tests (IR to MIR, MIR to
ASM, etc).
Some patches may be approved before others, but only after all patches are
approved that the whole set can be merged in one go. This is to guarantee
that all changes are good as a single block.
After the initial merge, the target community can stop numbering patches and
start working asynchronously on the target to complete support. They should
still seek review from those who helped them in the initial phase, to make
sure the progress is still consistent.
Once all official requirements have been fulfilled (as above), the code owner
should request the target to be enabled by default by sending another RFC to
the LLVM Discourse forums.
The LLVM monorepo is the centerpoint
of development in the LLVM world, and has all of the primary LLVM components,
including the LLVM optimizer and code generators, Clang, LLDB, etc.  Monorepos
in general are great because they
allow atomic commits to the project, simplify CI, and make it easier for
subcommunities to collaborate.
Like new targets, most projects already in the monorepo are considered to be in
the core tier of our support policy. The burden to add
things to the LLVM monorepo needs to be very high - code that is added to this
repository is checked out by everyone in the community.  As such, we hold
components to a high bar similar to âofficial targetsâ, they:
Must be generally aligned with the mission of the LLVM project to advance
compilers, languages, tools, runtimes, etc.
Must conform to all of the policies laid out in this developer policy
document, including license, patent, coding standards, and code of conduct.
Must have an active community that maintains the code, including established
code owners.
Should have reasonable documentation about how it works, including a high
quality README file.
Should have CI to catch breakage within the project itself or due to
underlying LLVM dependencies.
Should have code free of issues the community finds contentious, or be on a
clear path to resolving them.
Must be proposed through the LLVM RFC process, and have its addition approved
by the LLVM community - this ultimately mediates the resolution of the
âshouldâ concerns above.
If you have a project that you think would make sense to add to the LLVM
monorepo, please start an RFC topic on the LLVM Discourse forums to kick off
the discussion.  This process can take some time and iteration - please donât
be discouraged or intimidated by that!
If you have an earlier stage project that you think is aligned with LLVM, please
see the âIncubating New Projectsâ section.
The burden to add a new project to the LLVM monorepo is intentionally very high,
but that can have a chilling effect on new and innovative projects.  To help
foster these sorts of projects, LLVM supports an âincubatorâ process that is
much easier to get started with.  It provides space for potentially valuable,
new top-level and sub-projects to reach a critical mass before they have enough
code to prove their utility and grow a community.  This also allows
collaboration between teams that already have permissions to make contributions
to projects under the LLVM umbrella.
Projects which can be considered for the LLVM incubator meet the following
criteria:
Must be generally aligned with the mission of the LLVM project to advance
compilers, languages, tools, runtimes, etc.
Must conform to the license, patent, and code of conduct policies laid out
in this developer policy document.
Must have a documented charter and development plan, e.g. in the form of a
README file, mission statement, and/or manifesto.
Should conform to coding standards, incremental development process, and
other expectations.
Should have a sense of the community that it hopes to eventually foster, and
there should be interest from members with different affiliations /
organizations.
Should have a feasible path to eventually graduate as a dedicated top-level
or sub-project within the LLVM monorepo.
Should include a notice (e.g. in the project README or web page) that the
project is in âincubation statusâ and is not included in LLVM releases (see
suggested wording below).
Must be proposed through the LLVM RFC process, and have its addition
approved by the LLVM community - this ultimately mediates the resolution of
the âshouldâ concerns above.
That said, the project need not have any code to get started, and need not have
an established community at all!  Furthermore, incubating projects may pass
through transient states that violate the âShouldâ guidelines above, or would
otherwise make them unsuitable for direct inclusion in the monorepo (e.g.
dependencies that have not yet been factored appropriately, leveraging
experimental components or APIs that are not yet upstream, etc).
A new repository in the LLVM Github Organization - but not the LLVM monorepo.
New mailing list, discourse forum, and/or discord chat hosted with other LLVM
forums.
Other infrastructure integration can be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
Graduation to the mono-repo would follow existing processes and standards for
becoming a first-class part of the monorepo.  Similarly, an incubating project
may be eventually retired, but no process has been established for that yet.  If
and when this comes up, please start an RFC discussion on the LLVM Discourse forums.
This process is very new - please expect the details to change, it is always
safe to ask on the LLVM Discourse forums about this.
Suggested disclaimer for the project README and the main project web page:
Note
This section deals with legal matters but does not provide legal advice.  We
are not lawyers â please seek legal counsel from a licensed attorney.
This section addresses the issues of copyright, license and patents for the LLVM
project.  The copyright for the code is held by the contributors of
the code.  The code is licensed under permissive open source licensing terms,
namely the Apache-2.0 with LLVM-exception license, which includes a copyright
and patent license.  When you contribute code to the LLVM project, you
license it under these terms.
In certain circumstances, code licensed under other licenses can be added
to the codebase.  However, this may only be done with approval of the LLVM
Foundation Board of Directors, and contributors should plan for the approval
process to take at least 4-6 weeks.  If you would like to contribute code
under a different license, please create a Phabricator review with the code
you want to contribute and email board@llvm.org requesting a review.
If you have questions or comments about these topics, please ask on the
LLVM Discourse forums.  However,
please realize that most compiler developers are not lawyers, and therefore you
will not be getting official legal advice.
The LLVM project does not collect copyright assignments, which means that the
copyright for the code in the project is held by the respective contributors.
Because you (or your company)
retain ownership of the code you contribute, you know it may only be used under
the terms of the open source license you contributed it under: the license for
your contributions cannot be changed in the future without your approval.
Because the LLVM project does not require copyright assignments, changing the
LLVM license requires tracking down the
contributors to LLVM and getting them to agree that a license change is
acceptable for their contributions.  We feel that a high burden for relicensing
is good for the project, because contributors do not have to fear that their
code will be used in a way with which they disagree.
The last paragraph notwithstanding, the LLVM Project is in the middle of a large
effort to change licenses, which aims to solve several problems:
The old licenses made it difficult to move code from (e.g.) the compiler to
runtime libraries, because runtime libraries used a different license from the
rest of the compiler.
Some contributions were not submitted to LLVM due to concerns that
the patent grant required by the project was overly broad.
The patent grant was unique to the LLVM Project, not written by a lawyer, and
was difficult to determine what protection was provided (if any).
The scope of relicensing is all code that is considered part of the LLVM
project, including the main LLVM repository, runtime libraries (compiler_rt,
OpenMP, etc), Polly, and all other subprojects.  There are a few exceptions:
Code imported from other projects (e.g. Google Test, Autoconf, etc) will
remain as it is.  This code isnât developed as part of the LLVM project, it
is used by LLVM.
Some subprojects are impractical or uninteresting to relicense (e.g. llvm-gcc
and dragonegg). These will be split off from the LLVM project (e.g. to
separate GitHub projects), allowing interested people to continue their
development elsewhere.
To relicense LLVM, we will be seeking approval from all of the copyright holders
of code in the repository, or potentially remove/rewrite code if we cannot.
This is a large
and challenging project which will take a significant amount of time to
complete.  In the interim, all contributions to the project will be made under
the terms of both the new license and the legacy license scheme (each of which
is described below).  The exception to this is the legacy patent grant, which
will not be required for new contributions.
When all of the code in the project has been converted to the new license or
removed, we will drop the requirement to contribute under the legacy license.
This will achieve the goal of having
a single standardized license for the entire codebase.
If you are a prior contributor to LLVM and have not done so already, please do
TODO to allow us to use your code. Add a link to a separate page here, which
is probably a click through web form or something like that.  Details to be
determined later.
Contributions to LLVM are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, with two limited
exceptions intended to ensure that LLVM is very permissively licensed.
Collectively, the name of this license is âApache 2.0 License with LLVM
exceptionsâ.  The exceptions read:
We intend to keep LLVM perpetually open source and available under a permissive
license - this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM by
allowing commercial products to be derived from LLVM with few restrictions
and without a requirement for making any derived works also open source.  In
particular, LLVMâs license is not a âcopyleftâ license like the GPL.
The âApache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptionsâ allows you to:
freely download and use LLVM (in whole or in part) for personal, internal, or
commercial purposes.
include LLVM in packages or distributions you create.
combine LLVM with code licensed under every other major open source
license (including BSD, MIT, GPLv2, GPLv3â¦).
make changes to LLVM code without being required to contribute it back
to the project - contributions are appreciated though!
However, it imposes these limitations on you:
You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM: You cannot
strip the copyright headers off or replace them with your own.
Binaries that include LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an
included README file or in an âAboutâ box), unless the LLVM code was added as
a by-product of compilation.  For example, if an LLVM runtime library like
compiler_rt or libc++ was automatically included into your application by the
compiler, you do not need to attribute it.
You canât use our names to promote your products (LLVM derived or not) -
though you can make truthful statements about your use of the LLVM code,
without implying our sponsorship.
Thereâs no warranty on LLVM at all.
We want LLVM code to be widely used, and believe that this provides a model that
is great for contributors and users of the project.  For more information about
the Apache 2.0 License, please see the Apache License FAQ, maintained by the
Apache Project.
Section 3 of the Apache 2.0 license is a patent grant under which
contributors of code to the project contribute the rights to use any of
their patents that would otherwise be infringed by that code contribution
(protecting uses of that code).  Further, the patent grant is revoked
from anyone who files a patent lawsuit about code in LLVM - this protects the
community by providing a âpatent commonsâ for the code base and reducing the
odds of patent lawsuits in general.
The license specifically scopes which patents are included with code
contributions.  To help explain this, the Apache License FAQ explains this scope using
some questions and answers, which we reproduce here for your convenience (for
reference, the âASFâ is the Apache Software Foundation, the guidance still
holds though):
Note
The code base was previously licensed under the Terms described here.
We are in the middle of relicensing to a new approach (described above), but
until this effort is complete, the code is also still available under these
terms.  Once we finish the relicensing project, new versions of the code will
not be available under these terms.  However, nothing takes away your right
to use old versions under the licensing terms under which they were
originally released.
We intend to keep LLVM perpetually open source and to use a permissive open
source license.  The code in
LLVM is available under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, which boils down to
this:
You can freely distribute LLVM.
You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM.
Binaries derived from LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an
included README file).
You canât use our names to promote your LLVM derived products.
Thereâs no warranty on LLVM at all.
We believe this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM because it allows
commercial products to be derived from LLVM with few restrictions and without
a requirement for making any derived works also open source (i.e. LLVMâs
license is not a âcopyleftâ license like the GPL). We suggest that you read the
License if further
clarification is needed.
In addition to the UIUC license, the runtime library components of LLVM
(compiler_rt, libc++, and libclc) are also licensed under the MIT License, which does not contain
the binary redistribution clause.  As a user of these runtime libraries, it
means that you can choose to use the code under either license (and thus donât
need the binary redistribution clause), and as a contributor to the code that
you agree that any contributions to these libraries be licensed under both
licenses.  We feel that this is important for runtime libraries, because they
are implicitly linked into applications and therefore should not subject those
applications to the binary redistribution clause. This also means that it is ok
to move code from (e.g.)  libc++ to the LLVM core without concern, but that code
cannot be moved from the LLVM core to libc++ without the copyright ownerâs
permission.

Putinâs brutal aggression in Ukraine has put cyberwar back in headlines. Recently, Carey Parker, host of the Firewalls Donât Stop Dragons podcast, reached out to us at Tech Learning Collective to talk through some of the issues the war in Ukraine has once again raised for laypeople who may be newly concerned about the reliance weâve developed as a society on digital infrastructures. So, late last month, we sat down with him for another conversation about what anyone and, arguably, everyone could be doing not only to keep themselves safer online, but also prepared in the event of an escalation of hostilities in a cyber theater, rapid shifts in political climates, or even just natural disasters that affect telecommunication abilities.

Earlier this month, we republished part 1 of our interview with The EnragÃ©s, where we discussed our blog post, Imagining an Optimistic Cyber-Future. In this post, youâll find the conclusion of our conversation along with a (somewhat rushed) transcript of the same. Here, we touch on ways in which capitalism has constrained peopleâs telecommunication abilities, we describe some of our inspiration from earlier political thinkers, and we even answer a couple of listener questions.

We can see a glimpse of whatâs possible in Tech Learning Collective[. â¦] By going back to their digital roots, students become more aware of their immediate environment. Numerous possibilities open up when these students realize they arenât limited to the proprietary products of Big Tech; instead, they can build what they need on their own, thanks to free and open source software.
The school also advocates for cross-pollination. Their workshops are interdisciplinary, melding technical topics with the humanities, in subjects including history and philosophy. This allows for a more holistic development for the students. For instance, like they do with all their other courses, they teach cybersecurity through an explicitly political approach. They prioritize teaching security because of their audience, as many participants are also activists. They also cultivate critical thinking by encouraging their students to scrutinize technology from an ethical standpoint. [â¦] Thanks to their programsâ technological and political immersion, their students reclaim power over the work they do and are able to truly flourish.

The Tor workshop [I attended] was very slow, considered, and thorough, providing hours of spacious learning and the space to fully comprehend and learn. Although I did write down notes, I doubt Iâll need to refer to them, because of the pacing and thoroughness of understanding each step.
Rather than cramming too much information to retain, the tutor respectfully provided the core information repetitively, from multiple nuanced perspectives. That way, itâs gone in, I have done the learning while in the workshop, as opposed to needing to reread notes after the fact, and try to make sense of the information.
It was inclusive and respectful, and even the platform kinda helps with that, which gives you a screen of an avatar, and the option to collaborate either with your mic for voices, or by typing in the chat box.
Thanks again, TLC! I feel empowered to do this now!
I took the Tech Learning Collectiveâs âExploring Cyberspace: Network Sniffing and Scanningâ last night. Fun classâthese folks offer a variety of unique courses.

           By Nathan WillisSeptember 10, 2015
           
The Tor project gained an important piece of official recognition
this week when two key Internet oversight bodies gave their stamp of
approval to Tor's .onion top-level domain (TLD).  While .onion has been in
use on the Tor network for several years, it was always as a "pseudo-domain" in the past.  Its official recognition should make wider
interoperability possible (as well as shield the domain from being
claimed by a domain registrar).  

To recap, Tor first introduced .onion in a 2004 white
paper that described how hidden services on the Tor network could
be accessed.  A application designed for Internet usage (such as a web
browser) needs the hostnames of servers to be looked up through a
DNS-like mechanism that returns an IP address.  The .onion TLD serves
the corresponding purpose for a server running on the Tor network rather than
on the Internet, but .onion hostnames are substantially different.

The server has a foo.onion hostname, where "foo" is the
hash of the server's public encryption key.  When the browser sends an
HTTPS request to foo.onion, rather than performing a DNS lookup, the Tor proxy looks up the hash in Tor's
distributed hash table and, assuming the server is online, gets the address
of a Tor "rendezvous" node in return.  Tor then contacts the
rendezvous node and establishes the connection.  The end result is
functionally the same as the DNS case—the client gets a working
connection to the server—but the .onion protocol makes the
connection happen without either endpoint learning about the other's
location.

Informalities
The .onion mechanism works reliably enough that recent years have
seen several high-profile service providers add Tor hidden-service
entry points.  Facebook famously crunched through a massive set of
hash calculations before it stumbled onto its easily remembered Tor
address, facebookcorewwwi.onion [Tor
link].
Search engine DuckDuckGo, news outlet The Intercept, and several other
well-known web sites have followed suit (albeit without Facebook's
easy-to-memorize hash).

Nevertheless, as long as .onion remained an unofficial TLD, nothing
would formally prevent a new registrar from applying to the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to register and
manage a .onion TLD on the public Internet.  ICANN opened the doors to
applications for new TLDs in 2012, and has received several
thousand. 

There have been other well-known pseudo-domains in years
past—readers with long memories may recall .uucp or
.bitnet—but those pseudo-domains were never formally specified.
ICANN's new policy for accepting open submissions for new TLDs means
that such informal conventions are a risky proposition.  For example, RFC 6762 lists several
TLDs "recommended" for private usage on internal networks, including .home, .lan,
.corp, and .internal.  Of those, .lan and .internal still seem to be
unclaimed, but the ICANN site lists six registrar applications to
manage .corp and eleven for the .home domain.

Consequently, Tor's Jacob Appelbaum (along with Facebook engineer
Alec Muffett) submitted an Internet Draft 
proposal
to the IETF to have .onion officially recognized as a "special-use
domain name."  The proposal specifies the expected behavior for
application software and domain-name resolvers, and it forbids DNS
registrars and DNS servers from interfering with Tor's usage of
.onion.  Specifically, it requires registrars to refuse any
registrations for .onion domain names and it requires DNS servers to
respond to all lookup requests for .onion domains with the
"non-existent domain" response code, NXDOMAIN.  Application
software and caching DNS resolvers need to either resolve .onion
domains through Tor or generate the appropriate error indicating that
the domain cannot be resolved.

On September 9, the IETF approved Appelbaum and Muffett's proposal
as a Draft RFC, and ICANN's Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
added .onion to the official list of special-use
domain names.  That list, unlike RFC 6762, is a formal one; apart
from the reverse lookups for the reserved IP-address blocks, only a
few domains are included (such as .test, .localhost, .local, .invalid, and
several variations of "example").   

What's next
The most immediate effect of the approval will likely be that
general-purpose software can implement support for .onion, since there
is now no concern that the TLD could be "overloaded" in the future by
being adopted in a non-Tor setting.  Appelbaum, of course, has lobbied
the free-software community in recent years to start building in
support for Tor as a generic network-transport layer.  He proposed the idea at GUADEC 2012, and
raised it again at DebConf 2015.  Implementing system-wide Tor support
would not be trivial, but it is perhaps now a more reasonable request.

In the longer term, though, the official recognition of .onion may
have other ripple effects.  Facebook's Tor team posted an announcement
about the change, and noted that it raises the possibility of getting
SSL certificates for .onion domains:


Jointly, these actions enable ".onion" as special-use, top-level
domain name for which SSL certificates may be issued in accordance
with the Certificate-Authority & Browser Forum "Ballot 144" - which
was passed in February this year. 

Together, this assures the validity and future availability of SSL
certificates in order to assert and protect the ownership of Onion
sites throughout the whole of the Tor network.... 

The CAB Forum ballot linked to by the announcement proposed a set
of validation rules for issuing certificates for .onion domains and
for certificate authorities (CAs) to sign those certificates.  It
makes straightforward arguments—namely, that users benefit if
site owners can publicly prove their ownership of a .onion address.
Apart from Facebook, after all, most .onion URLs are quite difficult
to remember.

That said, the forum ballot passed with six "yes" votes from CAs,
two "no" votes, and 13 abstentions, plus "yes" votes from three
browser vendors.  That result might not be interpreted as
a strong mandate among CAs.  In addition, the CAB Forum is not a
governing body, so its approval does not necessarily dictate that any
particular CA will issue .onion certificates in the future.

Nevertheless, approval for the .onion TLD is undoubtedly a positive
sign for Tor and for hidden services in particular.  The project can
point to it as acceptance that the technology has grown in popularity
among Internet users and is a far cry from the "dark web" so often
alluded to in the general press.  Just as importantly, developers can
count on .onion as a stable service-naming scheme, which may lead to
interesting new developments down the line.

of validation rules for issuing certificates for .onion domains and
for certificate authorities (CAs) to sign those certificates.  It
makes straightforward arguments—namely, that users benefit if
site owners can publicly prove their ownership of a .onion address.
Apart from Facebook, after all, most .onion URLs are quite difficult
to remember.

That said, the forum ballot passed with six "yes" votes from CAs,
two "no" votes, and 13 abstentions, plus "yes" votes from three
browser vendors.  That result might not be interpreted as
a strong mandate among CAs.  In addition, the CAB Forum is not a
governing body, so its approval does not necessarily dictate that any
particular CA will issue .onion certificates in the future.

Nevertheless, approval for the .onion TLD is undoubtedly a positive
sign for Tor and for hidden services in particular.  The project can
point to it as acceptance that the technology has grown in popularity
among Internet users and is a far cry from the "dark web" so often
alluded to in the general press.  Just as importantly, developers can
count on .onion as a stable service-naming scheme, which may lead to
interesting new developments down the line.

The server has a foo.onion hostname, where "foo" is the
hash of the server's public encryption key.  When the browser sends an
HTTPS request to foo.onion, rather than performing a DNS lookup, the Tor proxy looks up the hash in Tor's
distributed hash table and, assuming the server is online, gets the address
of a Tor "rendezvous" node in return.  Tor then contacts the
rendezvous node and establishes the connection.  The end result is
functionally the same as the DNS case—the client gets a working
connection to the server—but the .onion protocol makes the
connection happen without either endpoint learning about the other's
location.

Informalities
The .onion mechanism works reliably enough that recent years have
seen several high-profile service providers add Tor hidden-service
entry points.  Facebook famously crunched through a massive set of
hash calculations before it stumbled onto its easily remembered Tor
address, facebookcorewwwi.onion [Tor
link].
Search engine DuckDuckGo, news outlet The Intercept, and several other
well-known web sites have followed suit (albeit without Facebook's
easy-to-memorize hash).

Nevertheless, as long as .onion remained an unofficial TLD, nothing
would formally prevent a new registrar from applying to the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to register and
manage a .onion TLD on the public Internet.  ICANN opened the doors to
applications for new TLDs in 2012, and has received several
thousand. 

There have been other well-known pseudo-domains in years
past—readers with long memories may recall .uucp or
.bitnet—but those pseudo-domains were never formally specified.
ICANN's new policy for accepting open submissions for new TLDs means
that such informal conventions are a risky proposition.  For example, RFC 6762 lists several
TLDs "recommended" for private usage on internal networks, including .home, .lan,
.corp, and .internal.  Of those, .lan and .internal still seem to be
unclaimed, but the ICANN site lists six registrar applications to
manage .corp and eleven for the .home domain.

Consequently, Tor's Jacob Appelbaum (along with Facebook engineer
Alec Muffett) submitted an Internet Draft 
proposal
to the IETF to have .onion officially recognized as a "special-use
domain name."  The proposal specifies the expected behavior for
application software and domain-name resolvers, and it forbids DNS
registrars and DNS servers from interfering with Tor's usage of
.onion.  Specifically, it requires registrars to refuse any
registrations for .onion domain names and it requires DNS servers to
respond to all lookup requests for .onion domains with the
"non-existent domain" response code, NXDOMAIN.  Application
software and caching DNS resolvers need to either resolve .onion
domains through Tor or generate the appropriate error indicating that
the domain cannot be resolved.

On September 9, the IETF approved Appelbaum and Muffett's proposal
as a Draft RFC, and ICANN's Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
added .onion to the official list of special-use
domain names.  That list, unlike RFC 6762, is a formal one; apart
from the reverse lookups for the reserved IP-address blocks, only a
few domains are included (such as .test, .localhost, .local, .invalid, and
several variations of "example").   

What's next
The most immediate effect of the approval will likely be that
general-purpose software can implement support for .onion, since there
is now no concern that the TLD could be "overloaded" in the future by
being adopted in a non-Tor setting.  Appelbaum, of course, has lobbied
the free-software community in recent years to start building in
support for Tor as a generic network-transport layer.  He proposed the idea at GUADEC 2012, and
raised it again at DebConf 2015.  Implementing system-wide Tor support
would not be trivial, but it is perhaps now a more reasonable request.

In the longer term, though, the official recognition of .onion may
have other ripple effects.  Facebook's Tor team posted an announcement
about the change, and noted that it raises the possibility of getting
SSL certificates for .onion domains:


Jointly, these actions enable ".onion" as special-use, top-level
domain name for which SSL certificates may be issued in accordance
with the Certificate-Authority & Browser Forum "Ballot 144" - which
was passed in February this year. 

Together, this assures the validity and future availability of SSL
certificates in order to assert and protect the ownership of Onion
sites throughout the whole of the Tor network....

sign for Tor and for hidden services in particular.  The project can
point to it as acceptance that the technology has grown in popularity
among Internet users and is a far cry from the "dark web" so often
alluded to in the general press.  Just as importantly, developers can
count on .onion as a stable service-naming scheme, which may lead to
interesting new developments down the line.

In the longer term, though, the official recognition of .onion may
have other ripple effects.  Facebook's Tor team posted an announcement
about the change, and noted that it raises the possibility of getting
SSL certificates for .onion domains:


Jointly, these actions enable ".onion" as special-use, top-level
domain name for which SSL certificates may be issued in accordance
with the Certificate-Authority & Browser Forum "Ballot 144" - which
was passed in February this year. 

Together, this assures the validity and future availability of SSL
certificates in order to assert and protect the ownership of Onion
sites throughout the whole of the Tor network.... 

The CAB Forum ballot linked to by the announcement proposed a set
of validation rules for issuing certificates for .onion domains and
for certificate authorities (CAs) to sign those certificates.  It
makes straightforward arguments—namely, that users benefit if
site owners can publicly prove their ownership of a .onion address.
Apart from Facebook, after all, most .onion URLs are quite difficult
to remember.

That said, the forum ballot passed with six "yes" votes from CAs,
two "no" votes, and 13 abstentions, plus "yes" votes from three
browser vendors.  That result might not be interpreted as
a strong mandate among CAs.  In addition, the CAB Forum is not a
governing body, so its approval does not necessarily dictate that any
particular CA will issue .onion certificates in the future.

Nevertheless, approval for the .onion TLD is undoubtedly a positive
sign for Tor and for hidden services in particular.  The project can
point to it as acceptance that the technology has grown in popularity
among Internet users and is a far cry from the "dark web" so often
alluded to in the general press.  Just as importantly, developers can

 Rund um den ersten Mai soll es auch dieses Jahr wieder die Anarchistischen Tage geben! Wir sind mit groÃer Motivation aus dem Anarchistischen Kongress in St. Imier gegangen und wollen den gleichen Geist auch auf die Strassen Leipzigs tragen. In verÃ¤nderter Konstellation und etwas grÃ¶Ãerer Gruppe sammeln sich bereits jetzt unglaublich viele tolle neue Ideen und PlÃ¤ne.
Westafrika - Seit Jahren gehen die Menschen im Senegal auf die StraÃen, um gegen autoritÃ¤re VerÃ¤nderungen zu protestieren. WÃ¤hrend einerseits der Wohlstand wÃ¤chst und sich das Land "entwickelt", wird das Ãberleben fÃ¼r einen groÃen Teil der BevÃ¶lkerung immer schwieriger.

I’m looking forward to the Reddit IPO, and I think it’s awesome that they opened up a top-tier IPO tranche to their community. People with 200,000 karma points or 5,000 moderator actions on Reddit will get access to something that has previously been reserved for the most elite allies of financial institutions. Wow! 
I’m sure this was not easy to do so Reddit users should understand that at this very important juncture in the company’s history it has gone above and beyond to include you. I’m mostly a lurker on Reddit so my 958 karma doesn’t qualify so I’ll get access with the rest of the normal folks.
If I ever IPO something from Automattic, it will include the same for people who have contributed to WordPress. And every supporting open-source project underneath it. (It’s turtles all the way down.)
My only fear is that code contributions are structured in a way that is easily legible, so is anything that happens on w.org, but we may miss including people who have contributed to the growth of WordPress in non-legible ways.
Going to the Super Bowl with my friends Jaime Waydo and Jason Hoffman was a peak experience, everything about the day felt par none. I captured some Spatial Videos so friends with Vision Pros could watch some of it, but there’s no good way to share those on blogs yet. Friends have asked for some photos from the day, so here they are.
This feels significant. Check out this video. Hat tip: Rory Chitwood.
I’m still doing some podcasts as sabbatical-Matt, especially with the WordPress community which for me isn’t really work, it’s building relationships in our community of practice. If you know me, I can wax poetic about WordPress for hours! It’s what I do for fun. Here’s my first post-sabbatical interview with Michelle Frechette. Another unusual thing about this interview is I was quarantining with Covid!
There has been quite a bit of buzz in the WordPress community because during the Grammys red carpet Taylor Swift’s website went down and this is what everyone saw:
Hey there! That looks familiar. What a beautiful WordPress logo! (Hat tip: Alexa Scordato for telling me about this.) The website also had some ups and downs, we haven’t been able to get in touch with anyone on Taylor’s tech team, but if you’re there, we’re standing by and happy to spin up your site on wp.cloud so it can handle any amount of traffic.
This gets even more interesting, because for the first time in my life, after having orbited around the Super Bowl for decades*, I am attending in person. Thanks to the graciousness of my friend and advisor Jason Hoffman, I’ll be in an owner’s suite, wearing a WordPress t-shirt, possibly not too far from Taylor, watching the game. Look for me on TV! I know she loves Tumblr so I’ll have with me a little gift bag of Tumblr swag just in case I meet her.
* How have I been orbiting around the Super Bowl? Even though I don’t follow sports, I’m obsessed with the Super Bowl, and typically host watch parties every year. I love seeing the pinnacle of American achievement. The Super Bowl centers around a number of interesting stories in my life, such as when I was in high school and very poor the Super Bowl was in Houston, and they made McNuggets really cheap, so I ate 104 McNuggets in one sitting. (Sweet and sour sauce, natch.) At that infamous Justin Timberlake / Janet Jackson moment, they needed extras on the field to be their audience and my high school girlfriend was one of the kids in the audience when it happened. There’s so many more stories I could tell!
Balaji Srinivasan posted a great essay on how founders should think about debt vs equity, unfortunately it’s on X/Twitter so the format isn’t great, but the content is gold. As we exit the ZIRP world and go back into normal interest rates, I think this is really important concept for entrepreneurs to understand.
The Washington Post writes The U.S. economy is booming. So why are tech companies laying off workers? This article has some good data, but I think misses the point with sub-heads like “Shine has come off the tech industry.” Really? How is that reflected in their stock prices?
I think a few things are happening.
First, tech companies are typically best at adopting new technology, which leads to productivity gains. 
AI may be an obvious example of this, though for all its hype it hasn’t had a huge impact on most companies yet. I agree with Sam Altman when he says there may someday be a billion-dollar company run by one person who is able to highly leverage future AI agents to automate most traditional roles at a company. That said, I think there are advantages to teams including allowing people to go on vacation or take time off, and provide business continuity and succession, so literally one-person is probably an exaggeration. We don’t need AI to see very small teams being valued highly: Instagram had only 13 employees when it sold for a billion dollars to Facebook, in 2012!
Some of this productivity gains just come from adoption of existing tools like Google Workspace or Office 365, issue trackers and version control with tools like Gitlab, Github, or Jira. At Automattic we don’t use email to work or communicate internally, it’s all Slack and P2. We also leverage our distributed nature to effectively have teams around the world coordinating several shifts of product work per day, and 24/7 coverage for things like systems and customer support without the need for “graveyard shifts.”
The way tech companies operate, the pace and culture, would be unrecognizable to people at many more traditional companies.
At tech companies some roles are highly leveraged, like systems, engineering, and design, and everything else in the company really exists to support these. These leveraged roles can create enormous amounts of value, and that’s why it’s not unusual to hear of machine learning engineers working on ads at Google with salaries in the seven figures. (There’s been a weird accounting thing where companies put a lot of their compensation into equity, but I think that’s going away as investors are learning to better account for dilution and employees appreciate the fungibility of cash.)
Creators are also highly leveraged, which is why Joe Rogan can sign a new $250M deal with Spotify (which smartly puts him back on Youtube) after laying off 1,500 people in December. Some people like Hagen TerschÃ¼ren try to tie this together and say you should avoid Spotify for it, but there’s nothing wrong with a business becoming more efficient to serve its customers, it’s the whole point of capitalism. Capitalism is, as Nicholas Stern says (via Marc), the best way to take care of people we don’t know. There’s no honor in keeping people employed inefficiently, it’s better for them to find someplace in the market where their talents will be better leveraged for society and themselves.
There was a bubble in hiring because tech had so much money it tried to throw people at problems. But the unlock in technology can come from a single person, a single insight. It’s the mythical man-month. Tech-first companies are going to become leaner and more leveraged. Fewer people are going to create more value for society, in ways that will follow power laws and I think we should investigate things like Universal Basic Income to provide for all living beings. Technological progress creates abundance, where we have more than what we need.
At Automattic last year we did not do layoffs, but allowed performance management and natural attrition (voluntary regrettable was 2.9%, non-regrettable 6.8% for us in 2023) to allow our size to shrink down more naturally, on average two people left for every person we hired last year, from a peak of about 2,064 to 1,936 today.
It’s hard to pick a favorite tenor player, but the GOATs that come to mind are Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Michael Brecker, and I’m missing people but if I had to pick someone to express the human condition and soul, it would be Joshua Redman. He has such incredible fluency with the horn you get an amazing emotional experience with his vibrations. He’s probably the greatest living tenor saxophonist. He just did a Tiny Desk concert, and the audio and visual capture was impeccable. I watched this full-screen on an Apple XDR and listened with Airpods Maxâthe chords they’re using, the subtlety of the interactionsâ the experience was exquisite. (Also peep HSPVA grad Paul Cornish!) I can’t embed because it’s not on Youtube yet.

What if this VR is training our brains to compute in a different way? How we perceive our thoughts to train the models. We are reconfiguring our model of reality to process things in a way we couldn’t before.
If I were President for a day, the first thing I would do is instruct our national security to patch and secure every American technology company, as they are our gems in the world. I would burn every zero-day I had on a US company and help them patch it. The rest of the world would know our immense defense budget was now being used to secure our companies as well, as China does. Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, Arista, Unifi, Qualcomm… I’m probably missing a few, they should all have the shield of our national security defense. Right now each company has to create their own defenses, and they are getting eaten and pillaged by foreign companies with state backing.
I’m a proud supporter of the Vesuvius Challenge, and they just announced the winners and have a great article in Bloomberg.
This is a brilliant ad, true genius. (Hat tip, Ken Gagne.)
When I read things like the iFixit Teardown of Vision Pro, I am moved almost to tears at the sheer beauty of craftsmanship in this thing. It is literally incredible. I have so much respect for the big tech companies like Apple that invest in long-term science, research, and development to create innovations like this. It is literally the engine driving our economy forward.
I just replied to an email from 2018. I am tragically, comically, behind on email. Because Automattic doesn’t use email, we use P2, it’s never been a priority for me. But I have been sloppy, careless, and derelict in my duty of answering emails. Apologies to you all. You’re going to get some weird, very late replies.
Okay… wow. The hardware and display are like nothing I’ve ever seen, really feels like it’s from the future. That said, I found the setup clunky and buggy. Some might have been user error, for example I kept trying to “select” things with my middle finger and thumb and not my left finger.
I almost got stuck in the Persona setup, couldn’t continue. I don’t love how my Persona looks. Looking and selecting stopped working and I could only continue by physically reaching out and hitting the buttons. (This must sound ridiculous to someone who hasn’t used a Vision Pro yet. I looked pretty silly!) 
I got totally stuck at the part of the setup where it was importing iCloud apps from backup, and I was ready to give up. A friend put it on and was able to get past that step for me. Adding credit cards was a terrible UI, with the security code PIN pad in front of the interface.
I decided to call it a night, and try more tomorrow. Just like I learned to type I think I’m going to need to learn to become fluent in this new interaction paradigm. I did have a before and after feeling, like the world had shifted, not unlike when you saw the first iPod or iPhone. This post probably doesn’t make any sense to someone who hasn’t tried the Vision Pro, but hopefully the team sees it and can take this feedback.
My friend Neal Mueller, who holds a Guinness World Record for longest non-stop row in Arctic open waterâ1,000 miles over 41 days in 2012âgave me the incredible gift this morning of introducing me to the Dolphin Club in San Francisco, which has a rich lineage of these hand-built rowboats and love of the craft of rowing. It was awe-inspiring. He then rowed me to Alcatraz! We saw a rainbow (third from last photo in gallery)! 
We captured some Spatial Video that will be fun to look at on the Vision Pro later (mine just arrived, but I haven’t opened it yet). 
I think what I learned this morning is there is something deeply profound about the act of rowing, of being in harmony and synchronicity with others on your boat, how good it feels when you’re in sync, and how obvious it is when you aren’t. I’ve done rowing machines before many times but never been on the open water, and I saw also the impact of the variability of the ocean, currents, and waves had on the rowing. I think there is also something related here to when autistic people (and myself!) rock back and forth when something feels like it’s in alignment.
Luckily I was with literally one of the world’s best rowers, so I always felt safe and was able to enjoy the feeling of being on the water, and really felt the heritage and respect of these beautiful craft we were on, Cronin-1938. I introduced Neal to the concept of the Ship of Theseus, one Matias and I love to talk about in the context of Gutenberg. One of the most beautiful days I’ve seen in San Francisco. Here are a few photos from this morning.
My sabbatical is off to a great start. âºï¸
Today is the day! The first day of my sabbatical. What an experience it has been. On Thursday I delivered my very first Ignite talk on the subject! Here it is.
The Ignite format is a tricky one as a speaker! I will do better next time. My friend Connie has delivered seven Ignite talks now and I thought hers and Adam Savage’s were the highlights of the ones I saw. (I didn’t see everything because I was popping in and out.)
Preparing for this sabbatical has been the most fun I’ve had working at Automattic, ever. It brought so much clarity to things, we’ve been able to resolve in hours things that have lingered for months, including two acquisitions, several hires, big strategies, and more.
After this talk I caught a redeye to NYC to meet with the WordPress.com leadership team and hand off my leadership there to Daniel Bachhuber. 
It is a beautiful symmetry that the first-ever sabbatical taken at Automattic was by its CEO at the time, Toni Schneider, which gave me the opportunity to step in and try on being a CEO, and it’s an incredible gift that Toni is returning to be CEO of Automattic while I’m out for the months of February, March, and April.
What am I going to do with all this free time? Blog a ton. So follow along if you want to see this journey. I’m going to try to open source all the things. ð
I was interviewed by Jason Lemkin of SaaStr, who is one of the most insightful people in the SaaS space and runs great events. Check out our conversation.
Considering I am going on sabbatical in 83 hours and passing the CEO torch to Toni Schneider until I return in May, it seemed like a perfect time to do a giant re-org! Just kidding. But we did introduce a concept into Automattic that I think will provide a lot of clarity for the teams within Automattic, and hopefully for the broader WordPress ecosystem that works and partners with us.
The frame is there’s a game, each person gets a card: Be the Host, Help the Host, or Neutral.
You cannot change cards during the course of your day or week. If you do not feel aligned with your card, you need to change divisions within Automattic.
If you’re Be the Host, you are hyper-competitive. You are trying to make the case to a customer for why they should host with you and not consider anyone else. This is what everyone assumes all of Automattic is, but it’s actually just one sub-division, which is a minority of our revenue.
For Help the Hosts, your word is ecosystem. You plant the seeds of open source software that grow everywhere. Every WordPress is precious to you, wherever it grew up. You want every host to be as successful as possible, because the real threat is from the Big Proprietary folks outside, who steal all your good ideas and donât let you touch them again. You want to get to know every WordPress in the world, however it grew up, and help it out by selling it attachments.
Neutral treats everyone equally, either because they don’t care (Day One, Pocket Casts, et cetera don’t have a horse in this race) or because they are a support function like finance or HR.
Whenever you meet or talk to an Automattician you can ask what their card is.
Also, WordPress.com is going to orient itself more towards developers, and have an experience that feels similar to WordPress hosted other places, less Calypso more wp-admin.
The big tension this surfaced was Woo Express, going forward that team is switching under WP.com, and Woo.com will recommend a variety of hosts (like W.org) to get started with Woo. Now people can meet with Paul Maiorana, who leads Woo, or James Grierson, who leads Jetpack, and know they have Help the Hosts cards as their teleological goal.
The Audrey Scholars program is still getting started, but I wanted to introduce another opportunity: Freedom grants. As the page says “If you are an open source contributor, and you feel your current political environment is incompatible with open source values, we would like to offer the opportunity for a grant to help you get set up in a new environment. Please state your case below.”
I’m not sure exactly how this will work, but we’ll figure it out together. The offer is out there. This is very much inspired by the work of the Oslo Freedom Forum.

We use personal information for journalistic activities to support a free press and to support individual and societal rights to receive information.
Our websites may provide message boards, blogs and other user generated content facilities. Anything that you share will become public information. You should always be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information. Please see our Terms and House Rules for more information.
We monitor comments for offensive/objectionable content and disruptive behaviour that breach our Terms.

We are not responsible for the privacy of the information you make publicly accessible via the comments section.
Our comments functionality is also subject to our Terms and House Rules. We will monitor and moderate comments, including for offensive/objectionable content and disruptive behaviour.
We use a third-party service provider, OpenWeb Technologies Ltd, to provide our comment functionality and to moderate comments, but we remain the data controller in respect of this activity.
By using our websites, apps and other products and services, we may process your information, including your name, phone number and email address, for the purpose of providing you with such products and services and managing our relationship with you, which shall include (without limitation):
We may also record phone calls or customer enquiries via online chat for quality, training and management purposes.
We may use your personal data (such as your name, email address, etc.) to provide you with digital event functionality and content, including recordings, user generated content and chat functionality. This may also include speeches or presentations, chat content, questions, poll results and audio-visual content incorporating your likeness, image or opinions.

We use your information, including your UID, to provide you with a greater personalised experience when you visit or use one of our sites or apps, and for insight and marketing purposes.
We make assumptions and draw inferences about your interests based on the kind of articles and content you click on or read.
We use this information to segment our audiences into groups with attributes. This helps us show you more relevant content/adverts and helps our advertisers target more effectively.
Our partner, Piano, assists us in understanding user journeys (e.g. which pages our users are visiting the most, which pages lead to the greatest audience conversion, etc.), user session length on our website/app, testing the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and optimising our website/app based on audience data. Please see Pianoâs Privacy Policy and GDPR policy.
Please note you have the right to object to profiling for marketing purposes at any time. If you wish to opt-out of having your personal information profiled for personalisation purposes, you can do so via the Cookie Settings.
Where you have given consent, we check to see if you have a cookie ID when you visit one of our properties. We are then able to compare the cookie ID we have to see if we know who you are. See Section 14 on Cookies for more information.
We allow partners to reach audiences on our platforms via data matching where they have appropriate permissions. We use your UID (together with other associated personal data such as email address) to carry out such data matching. This is conducted at an aggregate level or an individual level, depending on how targeted our partners want to reach audiences on our platforms. Your UID is stored with an independent third party data management platform (DMP) who will match UIDs with the data from advertisers with whom we partner. This matching is based on common identifiers (such as email address). This matching is completed using a data clean room where neither we nor the advertiser will have access to each otherâs data.
The data overlap between our audiences and these partners is useful to understand if an advertising campaign would be effective.
As part of the matching process, we segment audiences based on predefined attributes. These audiences may be similar to our partnersâ existing audiences and are therefore called âlookalike audiencesâ. For example, a female fashion brand may want to reach âwomen interested in fashionâ. This helps them find the right audiences and we are able to show you more relevant advertising.
You may amend your settings in order to avoid UID matching taking place in the future by contacting us (see Section 20 below) or by adjusting your account settings.
We use advertising to fund some of our websites and apps. Some advertising is âcontextualâ meaning it is shown due to the particular webpage you are presently viewing. Other advertising, known as âonline behavioural advertisingâ is shown to you based upon your likely interests, which are inferred from your browsing history. This information is collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies or your UID. For more information on controlling your tailored advertising preferences, please see Section 17 on Cookies below.
Sometimes we allow advertisers to show advertisements directly on our website and apps, which are tailored to you based upon information they have obtained, such as your browsing history on their own websites.
Other times we shall arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements on our own or other websites or apps. These advertisements are tailored to you with information we have obtained from your browsing on our websites and apps via cookies.
Where we arrange for our customers to be shown advertisements, we use technological and contractual mechanisms to protect your cookie data and to ensure that your browsing data used for advertising is not used by advertisers or other website owners for other purposes, such as linking online behavioural advertising data with your contact details, unless you have provided the advertiser or other website with your express permission to do this.
When you are shown an advertisement, our advertising systems do not know who you are or your contact details (such as your name, email address or postal address).
Your IP address may also be used, in connection with our legitimate interests to tailor the advertising we arrange to be shown.
We may also target advertising on social media sites to specifically include customers who have registered for our products and services.
Where we provide services that utilise your deviceâs location, such as local weather or news, your location will be determined either from a lookup of your IP address in a âGeoIPâ database which lists information provided by your ISP (usually your closest town or borough).
Sometimes we can collect the precise location directly from the device (such as through GPS or Wi-Fi on mobile devices) but only where you have granted permission for us to access this location information via your device settings. We use such information to provide you with a more tailored, relevant experiences when using our websites/apps.
Where you have granted permission to access your deviceâs location and consented to us to use your data for advertising purposes, this location information may be used to tailor the advertising you receive, including showing you certain advertisements when you are in the vicinity of a particular location.
We may use certain information (such as the websites that you visit and advertisements you see or click on and emails you interact with) to help us, advertisers and other promotional partners measure the effectiveness and distributions of their advertisements and promotions as well as the effectiveness of our own services and communications.
We collect information from your device to detect whether youâre using an ad blocker. This is to determine if we are able to show you advertising. As an advertising funded publisher, we rely on the ability to show you advertising.
We collect information via online survey units (Pulse Poll) and via our online research community of our readers (Matters Community) to help us better understand our readers and how they engage with the advertising they are shown. We collect this information when you voluntarily contribute or we invite you to contribute to any of our surveys, polls or forum discussions on our websites or online research community, for example when we ask you questions about your behaviour or response to adverts seen. We will also use your responses to our surveys, polls or forum discussions to send you targeted advertising, where we have your permission to do so. How we use data relating to our online survey units is covered by this Policy. For more information about how we use data relating to our online research community, please see our separate Matters Community Privacy Policy.

Advertisers: We may provide third party advertisers with reports containing aggregate statistical data about our websitesâ and appsâ audience to determine the reach of their target audience. This aggregated information may include demographic data such as age range and/or geographic location of groups of our customers.
This aggregated data does not include contact details (such as names, addresses or email addresses) that can be used to personally identify you or contact you.
Online Behavioural Advertising partners: We allow third parties to collect and use information obtained during your browsing activities in order to deliver tailored advertisements to you. These parties are listed in our Cookie Settings tool where we provide you with their details, links to their privacy notices and the ability to opt out of their use.
We may provide Online Behavioural Advertising partners, including DMPs, LiveRamp and ID5, with a unique UID or information that could be used to (re)create one â such as a hashed version of your email address, and they can collect or receive information about your browser and device, such as type of browser, browser language, browser settings, cookie information, device type, operating system, IP address and ISP information. This can help our selected DMP match our UIDs with data belong to our partners by using a clean room where neither we nor the partner has access to each otherâs data. This match is noted against our UID and use cases are established demonstrating lookalike groupings of potential interest to our partners.
This data sharing can also help partners continue to make advertising and site/app content relevant to users even if browser cookies are cleared, for example by re-creating deleted cookies (if you have consented to this).
Please note that ID5 may also use your user ID and/or internet activity information (such as browsing history) to provide, maintain and improve their services and products. This includes research and development activities (e.g. conducting machine learning to better optimise the efficiency of their products and services) and investigating, protecting against and deterring malicious activity (such as fake traffic).

        The sudden death of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's son-in-law has left the Royal Family and friends in a state of deep shock. The financier and former hostage negotiator was found dead at an address in Gloucestershire on Sunday evening, with emergency services called to the scene shortly after 6pm. An inquest will be held but there are no suspicious circumstances and no other parties involved. Mr Kingston is survived by his father Martin Kingston KC, his mother Jill Mary Kingston, and his sisters, Joanna Connolly and Emma Murray. Lady Gabriella, 42, who is 56th in line to the throne, and Mr Kingston were married for nearly five years, having tied the knot at St George's Chapel at Windsor in May 2019. One friend who spoke to the couple at a party last Wednesday at the National Gallery in London said: 'They seemed happy and positive as ever. Ella was particularly chatty.' Another close friend, who attended the couple's stunning wedding, added: 'It's utterly shocking. None of us saw it coming. I cannot understand it.'
      

                
                Thomas Kingston, Lady Gabriella Windsor's husband, has died aged 45, Buckingham Palace announced this evening. The couple tied the knot at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, surrounded by family and friends, on May 18, 2019.
            

        
        Tonight it was announced the son-in-law of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent had died suddenly on Sunday at a property in Gloucestershire.
    

        
        Tom Kingston was by all accounts a lovely man, as dashing as he was dishy. A financier, he also worked as a hostage negotiator in Baghdad, in the Diplomatic Missions Unit at the Foreign Office.

      Today the corporation said there had been 'shortcomings' in the way it dealt with the case and that the complaint was 'not escalated quickly enough' to top bosses. News at Ten host, Edwards, 62, was suspended by the BBC in July over allegations that he had paid a 17-year-old teenager Â£35,000 for sexual images over three years. It took seven weeks for the initial inappropriate behaviour claims to be escalated to the BBC director-general and for them to be put to Edwards himself. His identity was finally revealed by the star's wife in July after days of speculation, as she revealed he was 'suffering from serious mental health issues'. He has not returned to work since.
    

        
        Opening a Westminster Hall debate on the subject, Sir Michael Ellis said the corporation's reporting had 'fuelled the appalling rise of anti-Semitism' and 'harmed... efforts to bring an end to the violence'.

       Paul Ferguson, 21, physically retched as he heard his sentence of up to 100 years in prison over the sadistic torment and death of his autistic younger brother Timothy in July 2022. He was convicted on first-degree child abuse related to the grisly death of his younger brother Timothy, 15, who died after suffering a barrage of sadistic abuse from Paul and his mother. The autistic child weighed just 69 pounds when he died in their Michigan home, and had been subjected to merciless punishments including force feeding him hot sauce, depriving him of sleep and locking away food. The mother of the brothers, Shanda Vander Ark, 44, was also sentenced in January to life in prison without a chance of parole after a jury convicted her of murder and child abuse in her son's death.

The alleged killer local police officer Beau Lamarre-Condon, right. An intriguing character with a Walter Mitty side to his character, Lamarre-Condon - generally known by the surname Lamarre - baffled colleagues who struggled to reconcile his jet-set, designer lifestyle with his AUS$80,000 (Â£40,000) salary as a police constable. Now he stands accused of violent murder, allegedly fuelled by that age-old motive: thwarted desire. For while the exact nature of their relationship was unclear, investigating officer Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty revealed this week there had been 'some type of relationship' between Lamarre and Baird that 'did not end well'.

No further detail was given on William's absence, with royal sources saying his wife the Princess of Wales is 'doing well' at home as she continues toÂ recover after her abdominal surgery last month. William was last seen at the Baftas on February 18, while Kate has not been seen since Christmas at Sandringham. King Charles III was also absent as his cancer treatment continues.

        Just 46 minutes before the service at St George's Chapel was due to start, a message from Kensington Palace dropped as I stood waiting for the royal party to arrive, prompting ripples of concern.
    

       
       In an extraordinary turnaround after he was banned from royal duties and stripped of his HRH and military titles by his mother the Queen just two years ago, the Duke of York led The Firm into church to celebrate the life of the last King of Greece. And in another incredible turn of events, his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson was by his side as they marched into St George's Chapel this morning followed by their daughter Beatrice. Andrew was at front and centre of proceedings as King Charles takes a break from royal duties as he battles cancer and Prince William missed the service for 'personal reasons'. Queen Camilla arrived separately meaning that Andrew, the Queen Elizabeth II 's second born son, led in the other royals including Princess Anne. One royal watcher told MailOnline: 'Prince Andrew and the Yorks are firmly back in the fold'.

The couple, who come from two of India's richest families, have reportedly hired 21 chefs to feed their 1,000 guests at the lavish event at Anant's parents' home in Jamnagar this weekend.

Mr Kingston, 45, was found dead at an address in Gloucestershire on Sunday evening with emergency services called shortly after 6pm. An inquest will be held to establish the cause of death but there are no suspicious circumstances and no other parties involved.
            

        
        Royal fans have taken to social media to express their sorrow and send their condolences following the sudden death of Thomas Kingston, husband of UK royal Lady Gabriella Windsor, at the age of 45.
    

        
        The late Queen's cousin, 42, is the daughter of Prince Michael of Kent , and paid tribute to her husband in a joint statement with his family, describing him as an 'exceptional man'.
    

                
                When Thomas Kingston married Lady Gabriella Windsor five years ago, it was the culmination of a remarkable life that had seen him defy the norm. His wedding with the daughter of Princess Michael of Kent at St George's Chapel mirrored that of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle just a year earlier. But that was where the similarities ended, as the man equipped with good looks, charm, and a healthy amount of good fortune, entered royal life. Having survived a suicide bombing in Baghdad, negotiate with bloodthirsty militias and equipped with a healthy dose of charm and good looks, some would say he was well equipped to deal with life in the public eye. His sudden death at the age of 45 on Sunday has sent shockwaves through the Royal Family and brings to an end the incredible life of an 'exceptional man'.

                A 'despicable' carer who stole Â£30,000 from a disabled man she was meant to be looking after sobbed in court yesterday as she was jailed for more than two years. Rachel Dawes, also known as Rachel Evans, spent the money on Amazon Prime, Netflix , betting shops, jewellery and takeaways over the course of three-and-a-half years. The carer raided the bank account of 'vulnerable' Gary Stewart, who had learning disabilities, while fooling his family into thinking she was looking after him by inviting him round for Christmas Day. The mother-of-two was found to have left her victim with just Â£65.95 in savings and 38p on his electricity meter after plundering Â£30,765.30Â between September 2017 and March 2021. When she was caught Dawes, of Kingsway South in Warrington, claimed she had become 'overwhelmed' following the death of her mother and she wept in court as she was put behind bars on Tuesday, February 27.

                I have received love letters from admirers and husbands, writes Barbara Amiel, but I should start by saying the most precious have come from my present husband, Conrad Black, pictured right with Barbara. When we got together, more than 30 years ago now, he was constantly jetting around the world. Wherever he travelled, Conrad would send me a blazingly passionate letter, sometimes faxed to reach me faster. Soon after we married in London in 1992 (throwing a wedding dinner attended by Margaret Thatcher), when he was on a trip to Florida, he sent a fax to me back in London. 'My darling wife. What inexpressible pleasure it gives me to know and to write that you are my wife . . . I love everything about you, all of your past, every millimetre of your beautiful body, and all aspects of your personality, even when you are irritable and certainly when you are sad. 'Never mind this bunk about whether you are fulfilled with me; you are the culmination of my dreams . . . In the most important respect of all, we are never alone, never absent from each other's thoughts. I am aching to see and hold you . . . '

Owner Alisia Carrie, of Kamloops, British Columbia, captured the stallion peacefully strolling across a snow-covered field, and posted the 40-second clip to TikTok, where it's since racked up more than 16 million views. As Alesia observed, her horse appeared 'so black in the snow that you can't tell if he's walking towards you or away from you.' Indeed, it's near impossible to tell whether Rudnik is trotting diagonally toward Alesia or away from her for much of the clip, with the silhouette of his head and tail seamlessly blending into that of his torso and flanks.

What happens when Tor traffic is blocked? Can you make your data look like standard HTTPS? That's where Obfsproxy comes in...
Encrypting your internet traffic is the first step towards achieving privacy and security. How freely you can browse the web varies whether you’re using plain old HTTPS, trusting a VPN, or accessing the Tor network to stay anonymous.
But what can you do when your privacy and security measures are used against you?
Here’s how one of the Tor Project tools can help you get around strict censorship and surveillance.
Encrypting web traffic isn’t anything new. The majority of websites nowadays communicate using HTTPS and have a valid SSL certificate to safeguard users' personal and financial information.
But while most encrypted communication protocols are near impenetrable, they can still be recognized and blocked. For instance, your ISP or local government can ban VPNs altogether and ban all traffic going to VPN servers. Similarly, the same is being done around the globe with traffic going through the Tor network.
The demand isn’t for users to stop using encrypted web traffic. After all, you need HTTPS to, at least, protect your login credentials, notably passwords. So instead of abandoning virtual tunneling and traffic encryption, can you simply disguise it as everyday HTTPS traffic?
Obfsproxy is a Tor subproject built to mask how online traffic looks to network monitoring tools. The name is short for "obfuscate proxy", meaning to obscure or mask the fact that web traffic is going through a proxy.
Still, Obfsproxy isn’t just a side-project that's added to the Onion browser. In some places, it’s essential to access and use the internet freely.
When routing your traffic through multiple endpoints, Tor uses the SSL communication protocol. By blocking SSL traffic, your government and ISP can stop you from using the Tor network. That’s exactly what happened in Iran in February 2011, preventing thousands of Iranians from using the Tor network altogether.
While one answer to masking your Tor traffic would be to use Tor over a VPN, this drastically reduces your internet speeds. Also, it’s not a viable option if you live somewhere where VPNs are either banned or under strict regulations.
Obfsproxy wraps web traffic—whether it’s SSL, VPN, or via Tor—in a layer of HTTPS encryption, making it look like everyday online activity.
In order to understand how Obfsproxy (or any traffic camouflage technology) works, you first need to understand what they’re up against.
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is a type of data processing that inspects data moving through a network. You can find such algorithms in all kinds of network monitoring tools such as Wireshark and Glasswire.
While they can’t decrypt network traffic, they are able to look at the hints data packets publicly give. This allows them to determine the type of encryption, whether it’s SSL, HTTPS, Bittorrent, or VPN.
DPIs and network monitoring tools aren’t strictly for surveillance. In some instances, these tools can take direct actions and prevent a cyberattack or stop you from connecting to a suspicious server.
You can’t entirely avoid DPIs, but you can hide your traffic in plain sight. Depending on the policy, anything from Tor to VPNs and even self-hosted proxies could be blocked. All Obfsproxy does is make your ultra-secure and anonymous browsing look like everyday web surfing.
It can be tricky to add an encryption layer without a trace. But Obfsproxy is different. Its developers managed to add a wrapper around Tor’s traffic without leaving any evidence.
The handshake used in the additional obfuscation encryption has no recognizable bytes patterns. It establishes encrypted communication without alerting network monitors to changes.
Still, Obfsproxy only hides one aspect of your Tor traffic. There are still other telling data such as the timing, volume, and the data packet’s secondary characteristics that advanced DPI can still detect and block.
Obfsproxy isn’t an edit to the Tor network but a separate addition. That made it relatively easy to design and deploy on Tor without making lots of fundamental changes to it.
But that also means Tor traffic obfuscation can work in places other than Tor. For starters, if you’re into customizing your VPN connection, you can use Obfsproxy with OpenVPN and Wireguard protocols. However, you’ll need to configure Obfsproxy on both the VPN app and the server. So be prepared for a lot of complex work but with a worthy reward.
Obfsproxy was made to specifically hide Tor traffic from prying governments like China and Iran, but obfuscation technology itself goes beyond Obfsproxy.
Stunnel, for one, is an open-source obfuscation technology that’s been around since the 1990s. Similar to Obfsproxy, it can mask SSL/TLS traffic to appear like HTML. It also allows you to speak with servers that don’t natively support SSL/TLS without downgrading your encryption.
For purely evading censorship, Shadowsocks was created in 2012 to evade Chinese internet censorship and firewall. Unlike Stunnel and Obfsproxy, you can use Shadowsocks on its own without a VPN.
If you want the benefits of traffic camouflage without putting in all the work or simply don’t have the technical skills, you can go the direct route with a handful of commercial VPNs.
For example, Surfshark’s camouflage mode uses OpenVPN protocols, either TCP or UDP, to mask your traffic. The OpenVPN XOR Scramble takes a simpler approach by replacing the value of each bit of data. And while it barely affects the connection speeds, its simplicity means it’s not always effective, especially against advanced blocks.
Another option is Mullvad VPN. It works with Tor’s Obfsproxy through Wireguard protocol—although it’s slightly more expensive and technical than other VPNs on the market.
Whether it’s government censorship, a nosy ISP, or a streaming service, there’s always someone who doesn’t want you to encrypt your data. The need for obfuscation technology has evolved from journalists and human rights activists in certain countries to the average internet user.
Fortunately, tech companies are adapting fast. A lot of VPNs now offer built-in traffic camouflage mode and there are tons of tutorials online to help you take your privacy and security into your own hands.

Welcome to the fourth OnionScan Report. The aim of these reports is to provide an accurate and up-to-date analysis of how anonymity networks are being used in the real world.
In this report we will analyze how https is being used (and misused) by onion services.
HTTPS is still very rare on the Dark Web. Only a handful of sites have an active https endpoint, and only a tiny fraction of those present valid certificates.
We show that certificates can be used as another Identity Correlation vector - and site operators should audit their configurations and certificates to ensure that they are not leaking private relationships.
The lifespan of an onion service can range from minutes to years. When providing generalized numbers, especially percentages, we report approximate figures based on multiple scans over a period of time, rather than a single snapshot.
Of the ~6000 sites we have received a successful response from 276 (4%) were active on port 443.

It is worth noting that many of the certificates returned are not valid. The majority of sites present certificates for other, usually clearnet, domains. The rest are signed by unknown certificate authorities and/or are expired.
The only valid certificates were provided the following organizations:
All valid certificates that we found were signed by  the DigiCert certificate authority.
Fun Fact: The largest cluster in the image above (top right hand corner) are associated through the Let's Encrypt certificate authority.
By using certificates and their chains we were able to discover a number of identity correlations which were not detected using other methods. These correlations are summarized below:
There are also very strong indicators e.g. Certificates share and/or are valid for the same clearnet domains. This is an obvious identity correlation, though if present is unlikely to expose publicly unknown information.
Besides the obvious case that most of the certificates presented are not valid for the given onion address we noticed another interested pattern.
Many onion web sites serve different content on port 80 (http) than they do on port (443) - from the examples we have seen we believe this is due to  co-hosting where port http is being forwarded correctly, but https is not.
We found 66 instances of sites exposing different content via http and https. Many of these were minor variations (e.g. a default directory index listing which included the port number in the page) - however there were many examples of sites exposing completely alternative content, for example:
It should be clear that while it is not common, there are many instances of server configurations centered around https that may lead to site discovery or even deanonymization.

NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT
The London Underground is a bustling network that we use every day to get from A to B swiftly and conveniently. 
Well, except for when thereâs a delay, which is quite often. 
By now, Londoners know and understand most things about the intricate system. From routes to zones, to disruptions, and extra charges, we would be quite confident in calling ourselves experts. 
But did you know that you could receive a fine if you travel too slowly across the city? Because we didnât. 
Itâs common knowledge that you have to touch in and out at the start and end of your pay-as-you-go journey to avoid unexpected fines. However, it turns out you can also get a penalty if you go over TFLâs maximum journey time. 
Every journey on the Tube, DLR, London Overground, Elizabeth Line and National Rail Services has its own maximum journey time. The duration of these trips depends on the number of zones you cross, the day of the week you travel, and the time you choose. 
Travelling within Zones 1-4, Monday to Friday, 04:30 â 19:00
Zone 1 only: 1 hour 30 minutes
Zone 2 only: 1 hour 30 minutes
Zones 2 to 3: 1 hour 30 minutes
Zones 1-2: 1 hour 40 minutes
Zones 1-3: 1 hour 50 minutes
Zones 1-4 (for journeys across up to five zones within Zones 1-4): â 1 hour 50 minutes
Travelling within Zones 1-4, Monday to Friday after 19:00 and all day Saturday
Zone 1 only: 1 hour 40 minutes
Zone 2 only: 1 hour 40 minutes
Zones 2-3: 1 hour 40 minutes
Zones 1-2: 1 hour 50 minutes
Zones 1-3:2 hours 5 minutes
Zones 1-4: 2 hours 5 minutes
Travelling within Zones 1-4 on Sundays and Public Holidays
Zone 1 only: 1 hour 50 mintes
Zone 2 only: 1 hour 50 minutes
Zones 2-3: 1 hour 50 minutes
Zones 1-2: 2 hours
Zones 1-3: 2 hours 15 minutes
Zones 1-4: 2 hours 15 minutes
Maximum journey time limits also apply for zones five and six. See the full list of maximum travel times here.
London Underground imposes a maximum journey time limit, which is the permissible duration between touching in at the start and touching out at the end of your journey. 
If this time exceeds the specified limit, commuters are at risk of being charged two maximum pay as you go fares.

For example, if you travel in zones 1 and 2, Monday to Friday between the hours of 04:30 and 19:00, the maximum journey time limit is one hour and 30 minutes. 
After 19:00 and all day on Saturday, this increases to one hour and 50 minutes. Meanwhile, on Sundays and public holidays, the maximum time is 2 hours. 
Furthermore, if you were to travel across 10 zones Monday to Friday between the hours of 04:30 and 19:00 the maximum journey time is two hours and 40 minutes. After 19:00 and on Saturdays, it increases to three hours and on Sunday and public holidays, the time allocated it 3 hours and 15 minutes. 
To get the latest news from the capital visit Metro.co.uk's London news hub.
Transport for London says that the maximum time limits are set generously and will only be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. 
It also states that if you have been charged extra for reasons beyond your control such as a severe delay on a network, you may receive an automatic refund. 
To check your travel and payment history you need to make an online account. 
So, itâs time to start taking note of those travel journeys and avoid those pesky charges.

The Blob object represents a blob, which is a file-like object of immutable, raw data; they can be read as text or binary data, or converted into a ReadableStream so its methods can be used for processing the data.
Blobs can represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system.
To construct a Blob from other non-blob objects and data, use the Blob() constructor. To create a blob that contains a subset of another blob's data, use the slice() method. To obtain a Blob object for a file on the user's file system, see the File documentation.
The APIs accepting Blob objects are also listed in the File documentation.
Returns a newly created Blob object which contains a concatenation of all of the data in the array passed into the constructor.
The size, in bytes, of the data contained in the Blob object.
A string indicating the MIME type of the data contained in the Blob. If the type is unknown, this string is empty.
Returns a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer containing the entire contents of the Blob as binary data.
Returns a new Blob object containing the data in the specified range of bytes of the blob on which it's called.
Returns a ReadableStream that can be used to read the contents of the Blob.
Returns a promise that resolves with a string containing the entire contents of the Blob interpreted as UTF-8 text.
The Blob() constructor can create blobs from other objects. For example, to construct a blob from a JSON string:
The following code creates a JavaScript typed array and creates a new Blob containing the typed array's data. It then calls URL.createObjectURL() to convert the blob into a URL.
The main piece of this code for example purposes is the typedArrayToURL() function, which creates a Blob from the given typed array and returns an object URL for it. Having converted the data into an object URL, it can be used in a number of ways, including as the value of the <img> element's src attribute (assuming the data contains an image, of course).
One way to read content from a Blob is to use a FileReader. The following code reads the content of a Blob as a typed array:
Another way to read content from a Blob is to use a Response. The following code reads the content of a Blob as text:
Or by using Blob.text():
By using other methods of FileReader, it is possible to read the contents of a Blob as a string or a data URL.

When you visit a website, you can be identified and tracked through your IP address, third-party cookies, all kinds of tracking scripts, and through so called browser fingerprints. Thatâs why masking your IP address is not enough to stop the data collection. However, by using a trustworthy VPN in combination with a privacy-focused browser, you can put up a better resistance against the mass surveillance of today. That's why we partnered with the Tor Project to develop Mullvad Browser â a browser designed to minimize tracking and fingerprints.
The Mullvad Browser is open source and free of charge, whether or not you are a Mullvad VPN user.
Donât forget: your IP address is used to collect data. Use the Mullvad Browser together with a trustworthy VPN.
Big tech, authorities, and data brokers can use your IP address, cookies, scripts, and browser fingerprints to identify and track you online. Learn more about your unwanted followers and why you need a privacy-focused browser to stop them.

Using a VPN alone is not enough to achieve perfect privacy. Thereâs simply too much data being extracted through most browsers. So, Mullvad reached out to the experts on privacy-focused browsers: the Tor Project. Learn about the idea behind the collaboration.

Some browsers are made to map your internet behavior. Thatâs their business model. Others just donât have enough privacy protection. These are the questions you should ask yourself (or even better, the browser provider) before you choose a browser.

When you visit a webpage, most browsers give away information about your software and device. Combining this information with your other browser data makes it possible to create a user profile that can identify you.

In our world, thereâs only one way to reduce the absurd personal data collection of today, and itâs a classic: hide in the crowd. Take a look at the modifications and settings of a browser with a single purpose and ambition: for all of its users to appear as one.

All the content on this page has a single goal: to get as many people as possible to understand the importance of online privacy. Thatâs why we have simplify some things, and thatâs why we try to be as educational as possible. If you think all this is yesterdayâs news, go straight to the tech specification.

The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, making it available to 28 million children in the United States.
The FDA's move comes several days after its advisory committee voted 17-0, with one abstention, in favor of recommending the vaccine for children. The committee concluded that the benefits of vaccination outweigh its risks.
Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic
During a press conference Friday, acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock and director of the FDAâs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Dr. Peter Marks emphasized the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.
"As a parent, if I had young child children in this age group, I would get them vaccinated now," Woodcock said. "I would not want to take the risk that they would be one of the ones who would develop long Covid, who would develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or have to be hospitalized from the virus."
Marks noted that most of the children in the clinical trial were exposed to the delta variant. 
"The effectiveness here that was shown of 90.7 percent was likely in this setting of delta variant, which I think that's, again, it's very encouraging," Marks said during the briefing. Though cases are currently going down in the U.S., winter is approaching, and the delta variant spreads very well indoors, he said. "To me, the rationale here is protect your children so that they can get back towards normal lives and so that you feel more comfortable with the activities that they would like to go about doing."
The advisory committee's vote Tuesday had capped off a robust debate about the potential risks and benefits of the shots for younger children, as advisers cited concerns about the unknown rates of an inflammatory heart condition called myocarditis, and whether children would even need protection from Covid. 
âItâs always nerve-wracking, I think, when youâre asked to make a decision for millions of children based on studies of only a few thousand children,â committee member Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia, said Tuesday during the discussion. âThe question is, when do you know enough? And I think we certainly know that there are many children between 5 and 11 years of age who are susceptible to this disease who could very well be sick and are hospitalized or die from it.â
Committee member Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan, agreed.
âThe benefits of this option far outweigh the known risks,â she said during the discussion. âWe certainly cannot anticipate all the risk ahead, but we know we have systems in place that can help us do that. So, I think we have to take a step and say we want to make this option available for what it might do to help the children, as well as others in this pandemic.â
In a presentation to the FDA on Tuesday, Pfizer said its vaccine was nearlyÂ 91 percent effectiveÂ at preventing symptomatic illness in children, adding that it appears to hold up well against the highly transmissible delta variant.
Dr. Michael Kurilla, an infectious disease expert with the National Institutes of Health, abstained from voting. 
In a statement explaining his abstention, he said, "While there are clearly high-risk groups within the 5 to 11 age group for which this vaccine would significantly reduce serious disease, I do not expect protection from infection to last more than a few months and this may negatively impact public perception of vaccines."
Though children are less susceptible to severe illness from Covid, more than 1.9 million children ages 5 to 11 have tested positive for the coronavirus over the course of the pandemic, and more than 8,400 have been hospitalized, Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the FDA advisory committee Tuesday. 
Ninety-four children have died of Covid, making it the eighth leading cause of death in this age group, she said.
Kids who test positive for Covid are also at risk for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a rare inflammatory condition. As of Oct. 4, as many as 5,217 children of all ages have developed MIS-C, and 46 have died, Havers said, adding that the condition was most common in children ages 5 to 11.Â

The decision will now go to an advisory committee for the CDC, which will convene to make additional recommendations about who should receive the shots, for example, whether the vaccines should be limited to certain groups of children. 
Once CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signs off on those recommendations, young children can get start getting their shots.
The vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 is a smaller dose than the one given to those 12 and older âÂ 10 micrograms of mRNA versus 30 micrograms. Like in adults, the full vaccination series consists of two doses given three weeks apart. The childrenâs doses will come in vials with an orange cap and an orange label. The doses for adults and teens come in vials with a purple cap and a purple label.Â 
Pfizer's Covid vaccine is fully approved for teens and adults 16 and older, and may be given under emergency use authorization for children and teens 12 to 15. Itâs the most widely used vaccine in the U.S., with more than 243 million doses given as of Tuesday,Â according to the CDC.Â 
A vaccine for the youngest group in the U.S. â children ages 4 and under â is probably still a few months off, Marks said Friday.
That's due in part to when the children were enrolled in the trials, he said, as well as the careful considerations of the benefits versus risk, because the youngest children are the least affected in terms of severe illness from the coronavirus.

The worst team in the NFL is raising ticket prices.
The Carolina Panthers, who finished an NFL-worst 2-15 last season, are raising ticket prices by an average of 4 percent, according to the Associated Press. That means Panthers ticket prices are rising by slightly more than inflation; the Consumer Price Index rose by 3.4 percent in 2023.
Tickets on the lower level are rising by 7 percent while tickets in the upper level are rising by 1 percent, according to the report.
Given the results on the field â the Panthers have finished with a losing record for six straight seasons â it seems hard to justify any increase in ticket prices. But Panthers owner David Tepper is going to charge whatever he thinks fans will pay, even if that means a growing number of tickets are sold to fans of the opposing team.

TLS is also known by its older name, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLS is applied in a large number of contexts. Well-known examples include web traffic (https), email traffic (IMAP and SMTP after STARTTLS) and certain types of virtual private networks (VPN).
NCSC-NL has decided to downgrade the security level of TLS 1.2 from Good to Sufficient. TLS 1.3, a considerable revision of TLS based on modern insights, remains Good. TLS 1.2 is less robust than TLS 1.3 with respect to evolving attack techniques.
There are two reasons. First, various elements of TLS 1.2 were not re-used in TLS 1.3 because they were found to be weak. Second, TLS 1.3 contains less fragile configuration options than TLS 1.2. This makes TLS 1.3 simpler to configure safely. These differences make several attack classes that work against TLS 1.2 no longer applicable to TLS 1.3.

Yes, you can fly a drone straight into London's Big Ben in Watch Dogs: Legion
With Watch Dogs: Legion, the Ubisoft game about rebelling against surveillance states has finally arrived in the surveillance capital of the world: London. The English capital has one of the widest networks of CCTV cameras on the planet, with over 60 cameras per 1,000 people. Of course, that's not the only reason it's been picked. London is also one of the most recognised cities in the world. And Ubisoft Toronto â the developer who took over from Ubisoft Montreal, which is busy with another major 2020 release, Assassin's Creed Valhalla â also chose London for the diversity it offers, and the value of coming together to fight for a common good. That, in turn, fuels the new Watch Dogs mechanic: play as anyone.
It's why the game isn't called Watch Dogs 3 or Watch Dogs: London, but Watch Dogs: Legion. Unlike Aiden Pearce in Watch Dogs and Marcus Holloway in Watch Dogs 2, there isn't a central protagonist in Watch Dogs: Legion. Instead, you can choose to play as any London citizen (save for the antagonists that drive the story) once they have been recruited into the hacktivist group DedSec. It could be a young athlete, a beekeeper, a drone enthusiast, a professional hitman, a renegade judge, a former MI5 spy, or even an enemy who once hated your guts. Instead of building a legion of followers, as Watch Dogs 2 had you do, Watch Dogs: Legion wants you to assemble a team of myriad individuals â a maximum of 40 â who all bring something unique to the group.
This could be something obvious, like expertise with guns or drones, or access to resources such as a flashy car or construction tools. Or it could be something different. For example, a homeless man who sweeps the streets helps him blend into the environment, escape detection, and evade pursuit. Operatives, as they are called on Watch Dogs: Legion, have weaknesses too. Some include being a shopaholic, less physically fit, gambling away money, or giving themselves away in stealth due to a chronic medical condition.
Speaking of stealth, Watch Dogs: Legion involves a lot of it. It's not only DedSec policy to use weapons as a last resort, which is the game's way of asking players to prioritise hacking, the thing that drives Watch Dogs. Rather, going in guns blazing will attract so much enemy firepower that you're likely to find yourself overpowered. Even if you manage to sneak in quietly, there's always the rise of being spotted by a human or a drone. And if you don't take them out quickly and silently, it'll escalate to gun use. I found it much better to remain at a distance, hack phones to distract opponents and security cameras to discover a path to the target, use drones to move around facilities and then use the all-new âspiderbotâ â an eight-legged drone â to get the job done.

All this helps you tackle the threats hanging over London. Those threats not only touch upon the ideas that have been running through Watch Dogs' core from the start â the likes of datamining, mass surveillance, government overreach, and invasion of privacy â but also trade on civil rights, militarisation, immigration, authoritarianism, artificial intelligence, and human consciousness among others. In doing so, it's able to draw parallels to British history, from the recent debacle of Brexit to its days as a colonialist force. Watch Dogs: Legion shows London at its most dystopic, where football stadiums have been converted into âprocessing centresâ for immigrant detainees, and where civil liberties are routinely and aggressively violated, with the casual oppression on the streets.
Watch Dogs: Legion begins with a series of coordinated terrorist bombings (they will remind many of the 7/7 London bombings) in a near-future post-Brexit London, after a DedSec member and a talking artificial intelligence called Bagley put an end to a plot to blow up the Parliament (which is naturally inspired by Guy Fawkes' infamous failed Gunpowder Plot). A rival hacking group called Zero Day blamed DedSec for the attacks, and its members were largely hunted down and killed. Meanwhile, London's Metropolitan Police is disbanded, and private security firm Albion takes a very literal hands-on approach to rule of law. Albion is once described as the largest private army in the world. Bagley jokingly compares them to the British government, though in this case they are more like the East India Company.
With London's DedSec affiliate at its lowest, Watch Dogs: Legion asks you to pick your first new operative from 18 presets. With assistance from Bagley the AI and access to DedSec code embedded into ctOS (central Operating System) that has centralised all computer networks, you set out to build a resistance to take down the new military rulers (Albion) and find the real culprits (Zero Day). But that's not all. There are four main storylines on Watch Dogs: Legion â Zero Day hackers, Albion private security, Clan Kelley mafia, and a techpreneur called Skye Larsen. To help in your quest, you can even recruit Albion employees and members of Clan Kelley, who help you gain access to restricted locations that would otherwise be a lot tougher.

Recruiting is at the heart of Watch Dogs: Legion, and it helps unlock gameplay choices that were not possible before on previous entries. For instance, a construction worker can stroll into a construction site undetected. Barristers, on the other hand, will help reduce jail time for your operatives. You'll need them if you're arrested â depending on modifiers you've got on your team, you'll be locked out of your character for 20 minutes; that increases with successive arrests â which happens if you're detained in a place you're not supposed to be. Watch Dogs: Legion also offers an optional âpermadeathâ feature. If all your operatives are dead, hospitalised, or arrested at the same time, the game ends. Of course, this is more palatable in a game where you can have a team of 40 playable characters.
As you roam around London, you can select any passer-by to see what they have to offer. If you think they would be a good addition, simply add them to the team. In some cases, this would be enough to make them join DedSec. But in most cases, you will need to chat them up. Watch Dogs: Legion will also suggest you to hire skilled recruits from time to time. These recruit missions are temporarily available and must be started within the time mentioned. The process usually involves doing a life-saving or professional favour before they agree to come on board. It involves a bit more work if the person you're trying to recruit doesn't like DedSec. And if they are a sworn enemy of DedSec, forget it, because they will never listen to you to begin with.
To recruit someone who hates DedSec (a red thumb signifies that on their profile), you'll need to âdeep profileâ them, an option that becomes available with a tech upgrade. This shows their full daily calendar, from what they do for work, the friends and family they see, and any illicit activities they are up to. The game will highlight recruitment opportunities as you browse through their calendar, and you might have to spend some time observing an individual before you chance upon something you can use to recruit them. Watch Dogs: Legion wants its fictitious near-future London to feel like a living, breathing city, and the developers say they have spent considerable time to ensure that these routines don't feel like a hotchpotch of elements fused together by sheer randomisation.

For all the work that has gone into crafting the London populace, the interactions between them are hardly convincing. Your operatives simply walk up to strangers to try and recruit them. If someone walked up to me on the street in a heavily militarised city, asked me to help build a revolution, and join an organisation that's being blamed for multiple terrorist attacks, I would laugh at them and say: âAre you a cop?â It feels unrealistic that strangers would open up to each other so quickly, as Watch Dogs: Legion shows. The game does much better with the tinier throwaway moments. If you roam around in your Albion uniform outside of missions, prepare to hear profanity-laden insults shouted at you. âPigâ is among the words used.
Of course, the more important thing is what you get to do with your recruits. Most missions are about figuring out a building's labyrinthine layout by hacking into CCTV cameras and looking for the most hassle-free path to the assigned target. The last bit is usually a ctOS access port or an item that can be triggered or picked up by your spiderbot â that must stay hidden from enemies and enemy-controlled drones. In some cases, you'll need to unlock a network by solving a puzzle that involves a bunch of levers to reroute data flow. And sometimes, you will have no choice but to walk into the front door to physically interact with an object.
To help you stay undetected and navigate the complex web, Watch Dogs: Legion gifts you a wide array of technological upgrades â gadgets, weapons, hacks, and more â that you can unlock with âTech Pointsâ, one of three in-game currencies. You can make yourself temporarily invisible with AR Cloak or cloak enemy bodies with AR Shroud. You can disrupt enemies or jam their guns as you can get in closer for a melee takedown. Or you can distract them as you covertly make your way elsewhere. You can also disable/ hijack enemy drones or even have them betray their masters. Or you can deploy your own spiderbot with an automated turret to cover angles for you.

At times, there are so many things to hack in Watch Dogs: Legion, that with a quick glance, I wasn't quite sure what the cursor and imaginary line that points to it was actually attached to. Owing to that, on a couple of occasions, I accidentally triggered something I didn't want to, which led to guards being alerted and a temporary setback. In short: the UI can get overcrowded.
For our non-lethal tastes, Watch Dogs: Legion feels very much a drone game. After all, the spiderbot is technically a drone too, given it's a remote-controlled vehicle. My favourite mission takes place on the smallest of scales â it involves a mini-mini-mini-drone â and still kept me at the edge of my seat, thanks to the tiny margins that you've to perform within and the fact that it lacks in checkpoints, which means you've to be extra cautious. Another enjoyable one is set inside Big Ben, turned into a vertical platformer.
As you build out your DedSec team and tackle the missions, you'll get the opportunity to explore London. Well, more like a compact and redesigned version of eight London boroughs: City of London, City of Westminster, Camden, Islington & Hackey, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Lambeth, and Nine Elms. I took a walk along some non-touristy London streets that I remember and found them to be massively compressed. Albion has a tight grip and heavy presence across London, but you can do a bunch of activities to âfreeâ boroughs and turn them into a defiant force. Freeing a borough not only reduces Albion presence and makes its populace easier to recruit, it also unlocks new missions, a skilled operative (no recruitment needed), and the locations of all Tech Points.
You can move around London's boroughs on foot, in vehicles, or on the top of cargo drones. We didn't enjoy driving in Watch Dogs: Legion as there seems to be no weight to the game's cars. Bikes feel heavier and hence control better. You can also turn on a new âAutodriveâ self-drive feature for all vehicles on Watch Dogs: Legion if you don't feel like driving. You can use this to look around the world for hacking or recruiting opportunities, but Autodrive is buggy. It ran over a pedestrian once and brought down Albion heat, which forced me to take manual control if I didn't want to be arrested for the AI's fault. In other more forgivable cases, it would end up in the wrong lane and then have to take a detour, increasing driving time.

And that's not the only bug in Watch Dogs: Legion at launch. We encountered severe frame rate drops on multiple occasions with the Xbox One X. Watch Dogs: Legion also got stuck on a loading screen once; I waited 10 minutes and then killed the game. There are a lot of loading screens in general and they take a while (a minute easy). It's a shame Ubisoft didn't use the London Underground like Marvel's Spider-Man did for New York Subway to infuse some creativity into loading screens. Speaking of the Underground, you can use its stops for fast travel, which I preferred over driving.
Theoretically, that should be much less of an issue on next-gen consoles. Watch Dogs: Legion arrives on the cusp of console generations, with new machines due in two weeks or so. This isn't the best version of the game, and neither is this the complete experience. Ubisoft will ship four-player co-op multiplayer in December, and that is why this review pertains to single-player only. In its current state, Watch Dogs: Legion is largely about avoiding or studying humans. As such, it can feel like a lonely game. And since you can recruit and then play with anyone, there's no personality to the characters and no one you particularly care about. Watch Dogs: Legion lacks a soul. It's also a passive game, since there's no active push-and-pull. Albion took over London, and now you push them out one borough at a time.
Some of this is fitting, for what it's worth. For a game about hacktivists whose expertise lies in getting access to data that is being hidden or secured to keep the public in the dark, Watch Dogs: Legion usually tasks you to do just that â information retrieval. Multiple storylines deal with the human element, and how that's being erased with the promise of a safer and more advanced world. Except that's not what it's really about. Surveillance capitalism reduces humans to numbers and patterns, and if those ones and zeroes are going to take on the insidious power structures, it's going to require a large group of dedicated individuals â a legion.

Neo900 Labs Analysis: The ASN.1 vulnerability is negligible to Neo900.  Here's why.

                                You can now place down payments to partially fund Neo900 devices and NeoN boards in our shop!
                        

Go to the shop

Are you tired of all those closed mobile platforms? Do you want to truly own a device that has the ability to do whatever you want, just like your PC?

        The Neo900 project aims to provide a Fremantle (Maemo™ 5) compatible successor to the N900, with a faster CPU, more RAM and an LTE modem. This is all based on a free, mature and stable platform - the GTA04.

        We'll provide complete, ready-to-use devices, as well as motherboard replacements for your current devices.
Most importantly, the Neo900 is an open platform, carrying on in the tradition  of the Openmoko project.
        Neo900 will support all operating systems available for GTA04 (QtMoko, SHR, Debian, Replicant, ...) and should serve as a great platform for porting systems like Maemo, Ubuntu or Firefox OS - or even for writing your own one!
We bring the hardware, you choose the operating system.

The user name is admin. The default password is password. The user name and password are case-sensitive.
The BASIC Home screen displays.
4. Select ADVANCED > Setup > LAN Setup.
5. In the IP Address field, type the IP address.
6. In the IP Subnet Mask, type the subnet mask of the router.
The IP address and subnet mask identifies which addresses are local to a specific device and which must be reached through a gateway or router.
7. Change the RIP settings.
Router Information Protocol (RIP) allows a router to exchange routing information with other routers.
a. In the RIP Direction list, select one of the following:
b. In the RIP Version list, select one of the following:
8. Click the Apply button.
Your changes are saved.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) â After Thursday Walgreens shooting involving a pregnant woman and Walgreens employee, the family says she and her baby are both in stable condition.
She had three surgeries after being shoot eight times; four times in the stomach and two times in each leg. 
Her baby is in the NICU, only weighs two pounds. 
On Thursday a woman was in critical condition and required an emergency C-Section birth after she was shot by a Walgreens employee who was maced Wednesday night during a confrontation over reportedly stolen items. 
Homicide Unit detectives with the Metro Nashville Police Department are investigating the shooting, which happened outside of a Walgreens store in the 2500 block of Gallatin Avenue just before 8 p.m. 
The preliminary investigation of the shooting shows that 21-year-old Mitarius Boyd, the Walgreens team leader at that store, was informed by coworker that two females were stealing items from the store. Boyd told police he saw the women putting items into a shopping cart and personal bag before exiting the store without paying.
Boyd also told officers that he was recording the women with his cell phone as he followed them out of the store and to the vehicle they were unloading the items into. The report from Metro police says Boyd went to the back of the vehicle where the women were when one of them began spraying mace at him.
Boyd says he pulled out a semi-automatic pistol as he was being maced and began firing shots, claiming he was in fear because he didn't know if they were armed.
The women took off in the car, and Boyd called 911 from inside the Walgreens store. 
Travonsha Ferguson, 34, was shot during the altercation and taken to General Hospital by the other woman, who drove away after dropping her off and remains unidentified by police. Ferguson was transported by ambulance to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for treatment.
Ferguson was pregnant at the time of the shooting, so an emergency C-Section had to be performed. The infant was not injured by the gunshots. 
Both Ferguson and her baby are in critical but stable condition, says Metro police.
Boyd cooperated with detectives during the investigation. Investigators seized his gun used in the shooting and have taken possession of his cell phone.
Detectives will share the results of their investigation with the District Attorney's office to determine if Boyd will face charges.
Walgreens provided the following statement Thursday in regards to the shooting: "The safety of our patients, customers and team members is our top priority, and violence of any kind will not be tolerated at our stores. We take this matter seriously and are cooperating with local authorities."

          Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) are short stand-alone strings that a computer program can inspect to verify that an event happened on a proof-of-work-based blockchain without connecting to the blockchain network and without downloading all block headers. For example, these proofs can illustrate that a cryptocurrency payment was made.
        

          NIPoPoWs allow very efficient mobile wallets to be created. SPV wallets are already very lightweight compared to full nodes because they only require the download of block headers, not the whole blockchain. NIPoPoW wallets need to download only a small sample of block headers, around 250, when SPV clients need to download half a million block headers. The sample needed changes but doesn't grow much in size as the blockchain grows larger by the years, even after decades of data has been accumulated.
        

          NIPoPoWs allow blockchains to communicate and interoperate, like APIs. Because the miners that run a blockchain do not monitor other blockchain networks, this is difficult to do without short proofs. If a blockchain supports smart contracts, like Ethereum, a contract can be written to validate a NIPoPoW to check that something happened on another blockchain and react to it. For instance, a payment made on Ethereum Classic could cause a payment to be released by an Ethereum smart contract.
        

          Proofs about a blockchain can be produced only if the blockchain supports NIPoPoWs in its blocks. This support can be added retroactively without the need for a soft or hard fork and without requiring miner approval through the use of velvet forks.
        

          Some cryptocurrencies already include build-in NIPoPoWs support. ERGO, Nimiq, and WebDollar have added support since their genesis.
        

          We have published a series of academic papers on these concepts. If you're interested in understanding why NIPoPoWs are secure and how to use them in your blockchain system you can consult them.
        
This paper introduces NIPoPoWs, describes their construction in detail, formally proves that they are cryptographically secure by a computational reduction, and provides experimental results illustrating their security and short size.
This paper describes how to use NIPoPows in practice to build trustless communication channels between work-based blockchains.
This paper introduced the concept of PoPoWs, the first iteration on which the NIPoPoWs construction was based. It was published at the Bitcoin Workshop of Financial Crypto '16.
This paper further elaborates on velvet forks and practical deployment considerations.

          We are actively working on more papers detailing how NIPoPoWs can be useful in practice.
        

        Proofs of Proof-of-Work are based on the simple observation that some blocks achieve a better mining target than others. For example, the current difficulty may require that a block hash needs to start with 10 zeroes, but it so happens that some block hashes start with 15. These superblocks are rare and happen randomly. The idea with NIPoPoWs is that the whole list of block headers doesn't need to be presented to the network, as these blocks capture cumulative difficulty on average. If a blockchain portion has 128 blocks, then on average half of them (64) will have an extra zero in the binary representation of their hashes, a quarter (32) will have two zeroes, and so on. A blockchain can therefore be "compressed" by only sending these blocks on the network.
      

        The average distribution of blocks is illustrated in the following figure. The bottom part shows the regular blockchain. Higher levels show blocks with 1, 2, or 3 extra zeroes in their hashes. Taking only these blocks, one can form a superchain.
      

        If these superblocks are presented in the form of a proof, each needs to include a pointer to its previous block. This is similar to how regular blocks include a pointer to the previous block. This connectivity is called interlinking and is the reason why a velvet fork is required.
      

        The full details of how to interlink the blockchain, as well as how to produce, verify, and compare proofs are given in our papers.

Npcap Changelog
1.79
2024-1-19

Npcap is the Nmap Project's packet capture (and sending) library
for Microsoft Windows. It implements the
open Pcap API using a
custom Windows kernel driver alongside our Windows build
of the excellent libpcap
library.  This allows Windows software to capture raw network
traffic (including wireless networks, wired ethernet, localhost
traffic, and many VPNs) using a simple, portable API.  Npcap
allows for sending raw packets as well.  Mac and Linux systems already
include the Pcap API, so Npcap allows popular software such
as Nmap
and Wireshark to run on all
these platforms (and more) with a single codebase.  Npcap began in
2013 as some improvements to the (now discontinued) WinPcap library,
but has been largely rewritten since then
with hundreds of releases
improving Npcap's speed, portability, security, and efficiency. In
particular, Npcap now offers:


Loopback Packet Capture and Injection: Npcap is able to sniff loopback packets
  (transmissions between services on the same machine) by using the 
  Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). After installation, Npcap supplies an
  interface named NPF_Loopback, with the description “Adapter for loopback capture”.
  Wireshark users can choose this adapter to capture all loopback traffic the same way as other non-loopback adapters. Packet injection works as well with the pcap_inject() function.

  Support for all Current Windows Releases: Npcap supports all versions of Windows and Windows Server that
Microsoft themselves still support.  To avoid limiting ourselves just to the features and API's of our oldest supported
Windows release, we build and ship drivers for each major platform generation.  That way we can use all of Microsoft's
latest technology in our Win10 driver while still supporting legacy systems. Npcap works on Windows 7 and later by
making use of the
  
    NDIS 6 Light-Weight Filter (LWF) API. It's faster than the deprecated
  
    NDIS 5 API used by WinPcap. Also, the driver is signed with
    our EV certificate and countersigned by Microsoft so that it works
    even with the stricter driver signing requirements imposed by
    Windows 10. We don't know exactly when Microsoft will remove NDIS
    5 or cease the grandfathering of older less secure driver
    signatures, but WinPcap will cease working when that happens.

  Libpcap API: Npcap uses the
  excellent Libpcap library,
  enabling Windows applications to use a portable packet capturing API
  that is also supported on Linux and MacOS.  While WinPcap was
  based on LibPcap 1.0.0 from 2009, Npcap includes the latest Libpcap
  release along with all of the improvements we contribute back
  upstream to them.

  Support for all Windows architectures (x86, x86-64, and
  ARM): Npcap has always supported both Windows 64-bit and 32-bit
  Intel x86 platforms. But starting with version 1.50 we also support
  the
  new Windows
  on ARM architecture! This allows PC's to use the same
  power-efficient mobile chipsets as smartphones for all-day battery
  life and always-on LTE connectivity.  Users can now run apps
  like Nmap
  and Wireshark on a new generation of devices like
  the Microsoft
  Surface Pro X tablet and
  the Samsung
  Galaxy Book Go laptop.

  Extra Security: Npcap can (optionally) be restricted so that only
  Administrators can sniff packets. If a non-Admin user tries to utilize
  Npcap through software such as Nmap or
  Wireshark, the user will have to pass a
  
  User Account Control (UAC) dialog to utilize the driver.  This is
  conceptually similar to UNIX, where root access is generally required to
  capture packets.  We've also enabled the Windows ASLR and DEP security
  features and signed the driver, DLLs, and executables to prevent tampering.

  WinPcap compatibility: Software written for WinPcap is
  generally source-code compatible with WinPcap so it simply needs to
  be recompiled with the Npcap SDK to receive all of Npcap's
  performance, compatability, and security benefits. In fact there is
  even some binary compatability—software compiled with the
  WinPcap SDK often still works with modern Npcap.  We don't suggest
  relying on that, however, since compilers and other stack technology
  has changed dramatically since the last WinPcap SDK release in 2013.
  When porting legacy WinPcap software to Npcap, we do
  suggest a
  few minor changes, mostly to ensure your software uses Npcap in
  preference to WinPcap on systems with both libraries installed. By
  default Npcap replaces any old WinPcap software installs with its
  own drivers, but you can install both by unchecking Npcap's
  “WinPcap Compatible Mode.” installer option.


  Raw (monitor mode) 802.11 wireless capture: Npcap can be configured to read raw 802.11 traffic, including radiotap header details, and this functionality is directly supported by Wireshark.  More details can be found here.
    

Many more details about Npcap are available in the Npcap User/Developer Guide.  We've also created a feature comparison between Npcap and WinPcap.

Many more details about Npcap are available in the Npcap User/Developer Guide.  We've also created a feature comparison between Npcap and WinPcap.
The free version of Npcap may be used (but not externally
  redistributed) on up to 5 systems (free license details).  It may also be used on unlimited systems where it is only used
  with Nmap, Wireshark, and/or Microsoft Defender for Identity. Simply
  run the executable installer.  The full source code for each release
  is available, and developers can build their apps against the SDK.
  The improvements for each release are documented in
  the Npcap
  Changelog.
The latest development source is in our
 Github source repository.
Windows XP and earlier are not supported; you can use
 WinPcap for these versions.
We fund the Npcap project by selling Npcap OEM.  This special version of Npcap includes enterprise features such as the silent installer and commercial support as well as special license rights allowing customers to redistribute Npcap with their products or to install it on more systems within their organization with easy enterprise deployment.  The Npcap free license only allows five installs (with a few exceptions) and does not allow for any redistribution.  We offer two commercial license types:
Npcap OEM Redistribution License: The redistribution license is for companies that wish to distribute Npcap OEM within their products (the free Npcap edition does not allow this). Licensees generally use the Npcap OEM silent installer, ensuring a seamless experience for end users. Licensees may choose between a perpetual unlimited license or an annual term license, along with options for commercial support and updates. [Redistribution license details]
Npcap OEM Internal-Use License: The corporate internal license is for organizations that wish to use Npcap OEM internally, without redistribution outside their organization.  This allows them to bypass the 5-system usage cap of the Npcap free edition. It includes commercial support and update options, and provides the extra Npcap OEM features such as the silent installer for enterprise-wide deployment. [Internal-use license details]
The primary documentation for Npcap is the Npcap User's Guide. You can also refer to the README file on Github.  The changes in each new release are documented in the Npcap Changelog.


Npcap bug reports can be filed on the Npcap Issues Tracker. Please test with the latest version of Npcap first to ensure it hasn't already been fixed.  It is also helpful if you search the current issues first to find out if it has already been reported.  Then you can leave a comment on the existing issue rather than creating duplicates.  Feature enhancement requests can be made on the tracker as well

The last two weeks the dust settled after an energetic and productive Drupalcon. Now there is a new stable release for all of the three most popular contrib modules Nuvole maintains: Config Filter, Config Split and Config Ignore.
Drupal 9.3.0 was just released!
It contains a lot of cool new things we are excited about but for users of Config Split there is one change that will impact on what is split off by Config Split.
Thank you for a great DrupalCon! Here are a few key findings and PDF slides from our Thursday talk, Drupal for European Universities: Data-based perspectives.

This morning was the session on Config Split 2.x.
It introduced the new features of Config Split 2.x and why they are relevant for the planned new core module.

Attached are the slides of the presentation.


Config Split has worked mostly the same way as it did when the first beta release was tagged in 2016. The 8.x-1.x branch is using Config Filter as the API to hook into the configuration management of Drupal. But since Drupal 8.8 we have a much better API in Drupal core which allows us to do more complex things with simpler code than the Config Filter API did. The core API was designed with the lessons learned from Config Filter in mind after all.
Last week was the virtual DrupalCon Europe and I had the pleasure to present CMI 2 updates together with Moshe Weitzman. Attached to this post are the slides.
Amsterdam is the first city to host three European DrupalCons: 2005 (first DrupalCon ever), 2014 and 2019 (ongoing). How many community members attended all three of them?

We analyzed all user profiles published on drupal.org to find out this and much more.
Yesterday I presented the updates for the Configuration Management Initiative 2 at DrupalCon Amsterdam.

The main takeaways are:
When having to import data onto a Drupal 8 site there is no other choice than relying on coreâs Migrate API and its contrib ecosystem. At Nuvole we have adopted a so called "middle-format approach". The process simply moves the Extract and Transform parts outside Drupal so to ease the production of an easy to import dataset, in a well known middle-format (such as JSON API).
There are a few significant changes that landed in Drupal 8.8 with respect to configuration management. In this blog post we will give an overview of the most important ones.
Today I presented the CMI 2.0 updates at the drupal dev days in Cluj-Napoca.
The session went well and I received good feedback and had interesting conversations about configuration management after it.

Attached are the slides I presented.
Tomorrow Wednesday at 13:45 (Pacific Daylight Time) in room 6C we have the CMI 2.0 updates session at the Drupalcon.

Together with Mike Potter, we will briefly present the work that has been done so far and lay out the road map for what is to come. The session will be recorded and the slides are attached to this post (subject to change).
The configuration management initiative 2.0 needs your help.

I will be presenting updates of CMI 2.0 at the upcoming Drupalcon Seattle together 
with Mike Potter.
Config Distro allows distribution developers to say how the "distributions configuration" is supposed to be updated and it allows distribution-based site developers to treat the distribution maintainers as a developer on their team.
Drupal 8.4 and its upgrade to Symfony 3 has made the compatibility of the global Drush 8 a bit more challenging. Drush 9 works with Drupal 8.4 but it is not stable yet and the format of how third party Drush commands are made has changed significantly.

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	
The King’s next chapter will take place in Hollywood.
LeBron James is signing with the Lakers, Klutch Sports Group announced Sunday, agreeing to a four-year, $154 million deal.
The best player in basketball and three-time Finals MVP will try to resurrect Los Angeles, a massive victory for president of basketball operations Magic Johnson.
And a massive loss for the Cavaliers, who must be getting visions of The Decision all over again.
Speculation was James would do a similar two-year deal to Kevin Durant, with an opt-out after the first year, making him a 2019 free agent. But James wonât be free again possibly until 2022.
Knicks coach David Fizdale has a strong relationship with James, but likely will never have the chance to recruit him.

The internet runs on free and open-source code. LAMP is shorthand for the basic stack of applications that makes the internet work. It stands for: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. Together, those four pieces of software provide the foundation that lets us share both important dataÂ and elaborately filtered selfies all over the world. They are also all free and open-source projects, maintained by core teams of developers. These workers are the saints of the information age.Â 
Open-source has a tendency to be more stable than proprietary code, thanks in no small part to what’s called Linus’s Law: “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” Because open-source projects invite anyone to contribute, the idea is that lots of developers and testers will find and fix all the problems. It’s worked well so far, but it’s a theory that gets a bit creakier with age, as we’ve begun to see.
For example, another crucial application, the Network Time ProtocolÂ (NTP), has been in operation since at leastÂ 1985. It synchronizes actions taken by users across the web. So, for example, for banking systems, it can be very important to know exactly what order payments were made in, which NTP makes easy. The problem is, the codebase has been maintained by a shrinking core of developers, and facets of the codebase were as much as 16 years out of date when Susan Sons, a systems analyst from Indiana University’s Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research, began organizing a rescue for the software. Â 
‘My doomsday scenario is not that the internet falls down, but that internet starts to fall down enough that the public gets concerned enough that the Feds take over.’
Sons offered a corollary to Linus’s Law Wednesday at the O’Reilly Security conference in Manhattan. “If no one is looking at the code, all bugs are impossible to find,” she said. Sons gave a talk about how she and a team of developers came together to rescue NTP, ultimately resulting in a fork of code called NTPSec. Â Â 
She came to the conference to offer lessons learned from the team’s rescue of the code, because there is a lot of critical software out there that either needs a rescue or may soon. “Open source infrastructure easily becomes a tragedy of the commons,” she said. This point has been previously made by two key members of the Apache community, David Nalley and Daniel Gruno, who pointed out that the number of core contributors to the codebases of major pieces of software has gotten dangerously small. Â  Â 
“My doomsday scenario is not that the internet falls down,” she explained, “but that internet starts to fall down enough that the public gets concerned enough that the Feds take over.” In order to continue enjoying a free and open internet, the hacker community needs to make sure that the code that runs everything continues to work.Â 
“Sometimes you just have to say: There is an emergency, and no one is fixing it; and I am in charge,” Sons said. She hoped her talk would inspire others to make the same determination about some other key pieces of code. Â 
“It takes a certain amount of arrogance,” she added.Â 
After co-leading the build ofÂ a new version of NTP that’s quickly getting adopted around the web and leaving a team in place to Â continue updating, adding features and fixing bugs, here are some of the key recommendations she has for others who would undertake a code rescue:
In addition to her work at Indiana University, Sons now also runs the Internet Civil Engineering Institute, which is devoted to recruiting experts to addressÂ major issues in the software that runs the web.

onion-router
The Onion Routing program is made up of projects researching,
designing, building, and analyzing anonymous communications
systems. The focus is on practical systems for low-latency Internet-based
connections that resist traffic analysis, eavesdropping, and other
attacks both by outsiders (e.g. Internet routers) and insiders (Onion
Routing servers themselves). Onion Routing prevents the transport
medium from knowing who is communicating with whom -- the network
knows only that communication is taking place. In addition, the
content of the communication is hidden from eavesdroppers up to the
point where the traffic leaves the OR network.


Tor: Generation 2 Onion
Routing

The latest Onion Routing system is freely available and runs on most
common operating systems. There is a Tor network of several
hundred nodes, processing traffic from hundreds of thousands of unknown users.
(The protection afforded by the system makes it difficult to determine
the number of users or application connections.) Exact current and
historical number of Tor nodes and global traffic volume processed are
graphically depicted here.  The code
and documentation is available under a free license. Check out the Tor site for more details and
instructions for running Tor.


The protection of Onion Routing is independent of whether the
identity of the initiator of a connection (the sender) is hidden from
the responder of the connection, or vice versa. The sender and
receiver may wish to identify and even authenticate to each other, but
do not wish others to know that they are communicating. The sender may
wish to be hidden from the responder. There are many ways that a web
server can deduce the identity of a client who visits it; several test sites can be
used to demonstrate this. A filtering proxy can be used to reduce the
threat of identifying information from a client reaching a
server. Onion Routing currently makes use of the Privoxy filter for this purpose.


Hidden Services
 Web services and other services are subject to Distributed Denial
of Service and even potential physical attack. But if the logical and
physical location of a service is hidden, then it can resist such
attacks, even from those with authorized access to the
service. Providing hidden services and rendezvous points have been
part of Onion Routing since the beginning. See the papers "Hiding Routing Information",
and "Protocols using Anonymous
Connections: Mobile Applications", as well as these slides.
 The Tor design includes an improved approach to rendezvous points
and hidden services. (See 
"Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" or these slides for a description of
how they work.)  Hidden services have been deployed for the first time
using Tor network. The hidden
wiki includes a list of some hidden services and related
information. (A running Tor client and a proxy like Privoxy is
necessary to access the hidden wiki.)  Analysis of the security of
hidden servers, including both design improvements to more robustly
hide services and the first published intersection attack actually
conducted on a deployed anonymity network, is described in "Locating Hidden
Servers". Design suggestions to improve QoS and DoS-resistance of
Hidden Services are described in "Valet Services: Improving
Hidden Servers with a Personal Touch".  
A note about the use of `generation'.
Throughout these pages are references to different generations of
Onion Routing. However, terminology has varied somewhat
throughout Onion Routing's history. This
note explains and unifies the different uses.
An initial design for Onion Routing was published at the first Information
Hiding Workshop and deployed in mid 1996. In 1996, work had
already begun on a second generation
design and was referred to as such. (Some also called it `Onion
Routing: The Next Generation' in homage to a certain television series
of that era.)  The first publication reflecting any of that next
generation design was in a paper at ACSAC in Dec. 1996,
where running the proxy at a client not otherwise running a
node is mentioned in passing.  Much of it is specified and discussed
in the Oakland 97 design
paper, which was further refined and expanded in the JSAC 98 paper. There was also
a detailed specification. In
1998, there were multiple independently deployed networks of around a
dozen nodes each running on multiple platforms (Solaris, HP/UX, Linux,
Windows NT, BSD), and embodying most of the "next generation" design,
but none was ever publicly accessible. In mid 2002, design began on a
new system that eventually became Tor, which is thus at least a third
generation of Onion Routing. Nonetheless, in many discussions since
about 2002, everything from second millennium, preTor Onion Routing
tends to get lumped together as `the first generation design', while
Tor tends to be called `second generation'. In an attempt to maximize
coherence between these as well as to follow good mathematical
practice, we will consider the initial 1996 design to be generation 0;
all design elements after that and before Tor are generation 1; and
Tor, at least as conceived roughly 2002--2005, is generation
2. Readers should fudge on the cardinal/ordinal terminology in
whatever way is useful.

Orbot Problem Connection
if you followed the guide on how to configure orbot with the app but you have connection problems try to follow these simple steps.
in some cases orbot uses connection nodes that are too slow or that do not communicate correctly with the onion search engine servers and this causes connection problems with the app and does not display the sites or the app does not work.
To solve these problems you need to change the orbot connection nodes.

You want to change the OSPF link costs.
The auto-cost reference-bandwidth command allows
        you to change the reference bandwidth that OSPF uses to calculate its
        metrics:
You can also adjust the OSPF cost of a single interface with the
        ip ospf cost configuration command:
The custom in OSPF networks is to make the link cost inversely
        proportional to the bandwidth of a link. This isnât required, but it
        is common, and it is the default behavior for Cisco routers. The
        reference bandwidth defines the link speed that has an OSPF cost of 1.
        By default, the reference bandwidth is 100 Mbps.
However, if you have faster links in your network, such as gigabit Ethernet or OC-3 connections, OSPF canât give these links a better cost than 1. So you should set the reference bandwidth to at least as high as the fastest link in your network. In fact, you may want to set this value higher than the bandwidth of your fastest link to ensure that you donât have to reconfigure your whole network when you eventually upgrade some ...

A faster roll out of episodes would be preferred, as all the episodes are available for viewing on streaming services. By the time the episode analysis is released on here most viewers would have moved on.
Love this podcast so interesting to hear about what is fact versus crown fiction.  The hosts have a great rapport with each other too.
Iâve found this podcast series to be very engaging. I have watched earlier seasons of the Crown and found the earliest seasons to be very interesting. However I resisted watching the latest series covering recent events with which we are all so familiar. I donât need to be reminded of the harrowing details of Dianaâs death or the excruciating detail of the breakdown of their marriage. It has become a soap opera whereas the earlier seasons mixed in the politics of the day. However itâs interesting to hear Robert Hardman and Natasha Livingstone talk about what is fact and what is fiction, or somewhere in between.

Iggy Azalea claims she was forced to stop her concert in Saudi Arabia after she suffered a wardrobe malfunction while performing Friday night.
“Saudi Arabiaâ¦ Wasssssssâ¦. probably the worst possible place to have my pants split & unfortunately I wasnât permitted to end the show. ð¤·ââï¸ð¥²,” the “Problem” rapper, 33, captioned a slideshow on Instagram Saturday that showed clips from the show, including the moment her pants ripped.
“BUT silver lining,” she added. “The promoters were amazingly kind to me & the PEOPLE who came were the absolute most supportive.”
Azalea then said in a message to her fans, “I love you guys this was not what I intended for the show but itâs a memory Iâll have forever & ultimately showed me how kind, loving & supportive people can be while youâre having such an embarrassing moment ð­ð«¶”
The Australian rapper also addressed the incident on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating in part that her and her team “all wanted to continue but were not allowed by authorities because of [her] pants splitting.”
Azalea then gave further insight into what may have also led to the cancellation, noting in a separate tweet that she shouted at the crowd at one point, â’Ladies make some noise, itâs a womanâs world!’â
“And apparently that sent the authorities over the edge. Lol” the “Black Widow” rapper added. 
“Iâm cool I just didnât want the fans to be sad or angry at the show organizers cause it wasnât their control or mine it.”
It is unclear if Azalea plans to reschedule her show. Her reps did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.
A source close to the situation confirms to us, though, that Azalea “got through [the] majority of her set” at the Gamers8 festival before the issues began. The insider also stated that the government and police were responsible for the shut-down.

“Iggy hopes to revisit and that this doesnât prevent her from coming back,” the source adds.
According to a website for Saudi Arabia immigration, the dress code for women in the predominantly Muslim country has evolved in recent years, but female visitors should still “cover as much flesh as possible to avoid drawing unwelcome attention.”
“The key to following the Saudi clothing code is modesty,” the website also states. “You will be OK as long as you dress modestly.”
Fans on social media were divided over the ordeal, with some thanking the “Fancy” rapper for going to perform in their native country, while others placing blame on the musician for agreeing to perform there.
“Hey Iggy! As Saudi Fans we Just wanted to say how much we Loved & enjoyed your concert! ð” one person tweeted. 
“Your energy was Amazing and even though that unfortunate incident happened, it didn’t dampen our spirits. Your performance was incredible, and we’re already looking forward to your next tour in Riyadh! ð¶ð”
A second opined on Instagram, “Geez Saudi Arabia. Ur lucky the religious police didnât arrest you. ð”
Meanwhile, another wrote on X, “Itâs your fault because you knew very well where you were performing, please respect other countries cultures and laws.”
Azalea’s incident is reminiscent of what recently occurred at The 1975’s concert in Malaysia.
The British pop rock band was banned from performing in the Asian country after their frontman, Matty Healy, kissed a male bandmate onstage.
According to Malaysian law, same-sex activity is illegal and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with whipping.
Healy, 34, did not regret his actions and instead mocked the government’s ban, later joking via his Instagram, âOk well why donât you try and not make out with Ross for 20 years. Not as easy at it looks.”

We got a fresh Silksong sign of life courtesy of a rowdy Discord server that'd hoped to see the game at the latest Nintendo Direct.
After seven months since we've last seen the game, a playtester on Hollow Knight: Silksong took to the game's Discord to assure fans of its progress after a disappointingly Silksong-free Nintendo Direct this week. 

Long-anticipated videogames and squirrely fan communities obsessing over every detail or lack thereof go together like adorable bugmen and ill-starred underground kingdoms (remember in 2021 when Elden Ring fans were losing their minds because there was no new information about it for more than a year?), and the Hollow Knight community is showing signs of crossing a similar psychic threshold after the sequel did not make an appearance in Nintendo's showcase. 
Lots of memes about "copium" and "hopium," a few "Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams" type posts, and a prodigious volume of messages were the word of the day⁠—seriously it was more like a top Twitch streamer's live chat in there than any Discord server I've ever been on. Speaking as an outside observer, it looked like Philly after the Superbowl. 
In response to users proverbially climbing up lampposts and chewing on the walls, someone working on the game actually said something definitive about it⁠—Silksong's first official sign of life since getting shown off in Microsoft and Bethesda's showcase last summer.
"I feel for you all, I really want this game to release ASAP and the testers are working hard to get it out to you, as well as [Team Cherry] of course," One of the game's playtesters, Graig, assured fans (credit to Daily Silksong News on Twitter for the spot). "It will come and it is a glorious game worth the wait. Love you all."
In all fairness to the Hollow Knight Discord, the mood was light and Graig was largely playing along, providing playful and clearly ludicrous fake release dates before this assurance. I'd largely characterize the chat as more "lively" than "upset," but there was one guy in there with a Lando Calrissian profile picture who joked about setting fire to Team Cherry HQ. Kind of a nerf herder thing to say if I'm being honest. There's nothing particularly illuminating about Graig's statement, but it's still a nice proof-of-life for the long-awaited Metroidvania. Silksong is real and there is a small, secret cabal that is playing it right now.
It is interesting how Nintendo Directs have become a default source of hype and speculation for Silksong fans⁠—in mirrors of the livestreams with an open chat, I always notice a ton of people spamming the topic. It has to be a residual excitement from the game's reveal and 20-minute gameplay demonstration as a part of Nintendo's E3 2019 presence, though the only looks of the game we've gotten since have come courtesy of Edge Magazine and Microsoft. As PC Gamer senior editor Wes Fenlon put it, "Every big press conference is a new opportunity for disappointment."
Silksong still has no official release date, and your best bet remains facing an uncertain wait with grace and dignity⁠—not joking about burning down the studio. Maybe try Tunic while you wait, that game's got some nice Hollow Knight vibes. Otherwise you can check out our guide to everything we know about Hollow Knight: Silksong.

This site only provides a simple and easy-to-use tool for people to generate PGP keys
with. Today, the common methods for generating keys still involve going to a command
prompt of a Linux/Unix machine and using the GPG utility, or installing a PGP compatible
application on your desktop. I wanted to provide an easier way to generate keys. None of
this would be possible without the awesome Open Source software I'm utilizing. I'm
using KeyBase's awesome JavaScript implementation of
PGP (kbpgp). For file saving capabilities
I am utilizing Eli Grey's wonderful
FileSaver.js interface.

pidgin
Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log into accounts on multiple chat
                    networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on
                    XMPP and sitting in an IRC channel at the same time.
Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX-like operating systems. Looking
                    for Pidgin for macOS? Try Adium!
Pidgin is compatible with the following chat networks out of the box:
                    Jabber/XMPP, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, Novell GroupWise Messenger, Lotus
                    Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE, and Zephyr. It can support many more with
                    plugins.
Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers,
                    away messages, buddy icons, custom smileys, and typing notifications. Numerous
                    plugins also extend Pidgin’s functionality above and beyond the standard
                    features.
Pidgin is under constant development. Releases are usually frequent and driven
                    by user contributions, such as
                    issues and
                    contributions.
Pidgin is free and contains no ads. All our code is open source and licensed
                    under the GNU General Public License. This means you can get Pidgin’s underlying
                    code and modify it to suit your needs, as long as you publish the changes you
                    make for everyone to benefit from as well.
Pidgin is translated into many different languages, thanks to the generous contributions of our
                    volunteer translators.

poez

    Poezio is a free console XMPP client
    (the protocol on which the Jabber IM network is built).
    

    Its goal is to let you connect very easily (no account creation
    needed) to the network and join various chatrooms, immediately. It tries
    to look like the most famous IRC clients (weechat, irssi, etc). Many
    commands are identical and you won't be lost if you already know these
    clients. Configuration can be made in a configuration file or directly
    from the client.
    

    You'll find the light, fast, geeky and anonymous spirit of IRC while using
    a powerful, standard and open protocol.
    
TLS, OMEMO, always chat with encryption.
Discuss on your favorite topics with your friends or strangers.
Switch devices while staying in the same conversations without losing messages.
Add the features you want through official or other plugins.
Fix your last sent messages.
Send and receive messages with colors and formatting.
See the writing status of your contacts.
Use XMPP without an account.

    First install python 3.7 or above (and the -devel
    package associated with it), git, then enter the following in your console:
    

git clone https://codeberg.org/poezio/poezio.git
      cd poezio
      ./update.sh
      ./launch.sh
    


    Then, you can use ./update.sh to update the sources
    and the dependencies, from time to time, if you want to
    test the new features, and be able to report bugs to us.
    

    Alternatively, here are the more conventional downloads; follow the

This report was last updated: 28-Feb-2024 07:50 UTC





  This report is generated on a daily basis, and describes the current
  state of allocation of 16-bit Autonomous System numbers. 

  


  Using a model of each RIR's relative rate of allocation, it is
  possible to generate a model of 16-bit AS number consumption. Here the end
  point is the date where the first RIR has exhausted its available
  pool of 16-bit AS numbers, and no further numbers are available in
  the IANA unallocated pool to replenish the RIR's pool. The data
  available suggests a best fit predictive model where this will occur
  on 09-Jan-2023.

  


  Following an IETF standards action in November 2006, the Internet
  Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has extended the AS Number field
  to 32 bits in size, increasing the pool size from 65536 to
  4,294,967,296 values. As of January 2007 32 bit AS numbers are
  available for assignment from the Regional Internet Number
  Registries (RIRs). A similar report, looking at the allocation
  state of the entire 32-bit AS number pool can be found
  here.

  


  The (now historical) 16-bit Autonomous System number space is a 16 bit field, with 65,536
  unique values. From this pool 1023 numbers are reserved for local or
  private use, and 3 are reserved for special use. The remaining pool
  of 64510 numbers are available for use to support the Internet's
  public inter-domain routing system. IANA holds a pool of unallocated
  AS numbers, while the remainder have already been allocated by IANA
  for assignment.

  

Figure 1 - AS Number Pool Status



  This allocated number pool is managed by the Regional Internet Registries,
  (RIRs) and the breakdown of IANA allocated AS number blocks to each of the
  RIRs is as follows:

  

Figure 2 - AS allocations to RIRs



  Any individual AS number can be in any one of four states: part of
  the IANA unallocated number pool, part of the unassigned pool held
  by an RIR, assigned to an end user entity but not advertised in the
  routing system, and assigned and advertised in BGP. The current
  totals of AS numbers according to this set of states is:

  

Figure 3 - AS Pools by State



  This status can be further categorized per RIR:

  

Figure 4 - AS Pools by RIR by State



  Another view of the AS number state pools is by grouping the AS
  numbers numerically. The following view shows all 65536 AS numbers,
  using 256 columns each describing a pool of 256 AS numbers. The IANA
  pool is formed from the higher numbered ASs. Within the allocated
  blocks, the lower-numbered AS blocks have a higher rate of assigned
  by unadvertised ASs as compared to higher numbered assigned AS
  numbers.

  

Figure 5 - AS Number Status



  AS numbers are drawn from the Unallocated AS Number Pool,
  administered by the IANA. The IANA data from the period 1992 until
  the present is shown in the following time series. These allocations
  are made to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and the
  allocation unit is in blocks of 1024 AS Numbers.

  This series can be further broken down by tracking the cumulative
  number of AS's that have been allocated to each of the 5 current
  RIRs.  This in indicated below.

  


Figure 7 - Cumulative IANA AS block allocations per RIR



  RIRs perform assignments of AS numbers to ISPs and end user
  entities. The cumulative number of assigned AS numbers over time is
  shown in the following figure.

  


Figure 8 - Cumulative RIR AS assignments



  This data can be further categorized by the assigning RIR.

  


Figure 9 - Cumulative RIR AS assignments per RIR



  Each RIR allocates from its IANA-Allocated number pool. When the pool
  reaches a low threshold amount a further 1024 AS number block is allocated
  by IANA to the RIR. The pool size within each RIR can be derived from
  the allocation and assignment series data, producing the following graph.
  The total RIR pool size current is in the range of 4,000 to 7,000 AS
  numbers across the RIR system.

  


Figure 10 - RIR AS Number Pool size



  The next data set is the number of unique ASN's advertised in the
  BGP routing table over time. This data has been regularly collected
  since 1997, and the total data series is shown below. The data has
  three distinct phases: the pre-Internet boom prior to 1999, the
  sharp upward growth during the boom period from 1999 until early
  2001, and the post-boom data.

  


Figure 11 - Advertised AS Count



  The difference between the assigned AS number count and the
  advertised AS number count is the unadvertised AS count. The
  following figure shows the number of advertised and advertised ASs
  as a time series.

  


Figure 12 - Advertised / Unadvertised AS Count



  The ratio of unadvertised to advertised AS numbers can be plotted
  over time.

  


Figure 13 - Advertised / Unadvertised AS Count




  Taking the current set of assigned AS numbers, the set of advertised
  and unadvertised AS numbers can be matched against the RIR date of
  assignment. This is shown below.

  


Figure 14 - Advertised / Unadvertised Assignment Series



  The ratio between these values for each month is shown below.

  


Figure 15 - Advertised / Unadvertised Ratio Series



  The complete picture of AS number allocations, assignments and
  advertisements can be assembled from these sequences.

  


Figure 17 - AS Allocation and Assignment Series


  The question posed in this section is: when will the pool of
  16 bite AS numbers be exhausted? The methodology used here is that
  of using previous allocation information to generate a trend model,
  and use that trend to extrapolate likely future consumption levels,
  and thereby generate a predicted exhaustion point. Of course making assumptions
  about the future has its risks, and often the future does not conform to
  current expectations. This is a quote from RFC1930, published in March 1996:

  



   9. AS Space exhaustion

   The AS number space is a finite amount of address space. It is
   currently defined as a 16 bit integer and hence limited to 65535
   unique AS numbers. At the time of writing some 5,100 ASes have been
   allocated and a little under 600 ASes are actively routed in the
   global Internet. It is clear that this growth needs to be continually
   monitored. However, if the criteria applied above are adhered to,
   then there is no immediate danger of AS space exhaustion. It is
   expected that IDRP will be deployed before this becomes an issue.
   IDRP does not have a fixed limit on the size of an RDI.


   RFC 1930, "Guidelines for creation of an AS" J. Hawkinson, T. Bates,
   March 1996.
  




  With that cautionary note about making assumptions about the future in mind,
  it is now possible to use this data to generate some predictive
  models of AS Number consumption. The technique used here is to use
  recent AS number consumption data in a time series, apply a best fit to the data using
  a least squares best fit, and then using the derived slope and
  intercept to generate a predictive trend line. This technique
  provides a linear best fit projection model. It may be the case that
  the underlying environment is driven by compound rowth factors that
  create accelerating growth. The technique used here is to perform a
  least squares best fit on the logarithm of the data points, derive
  the best fit slope and intercept to generate a trend series, and
  then exponentiate the trend data to create a best fit trend model
  that exhibts exponential growth.

  


  The first data series analysed in this fashion is that of the IANA
  allocation series. The past 900 days of IANA allocation activity
  have been analyzed using both linear and exponentrend analysis. The
  outcomes are indicated below.

  


Figure 18 - IANA Allocation projection



  The second view is that of projection of the RIR allocation
  series. Again linear and exponential models are used in the
  projections.

  


Figure 19 - RIR Assignment projection


  
  It's possible to reverse this view and look at the total pool of unallocated
  address, and assume a "perfect" consumption model whereby the pool is
  drained uniformly.

  


Figure 20 - RIR Unallocated Pool projection



  The third view is that of projection of the advertised AS count.
  The assumption underlying this projection is that all the
  unadvertised ASs would ultimately be used in the advertised BGP
  table.  Again linear and exponential models are used in the
  projections.

  


Figure 21 - RIR Assignment projection





  The final step is to generate a model of AS number consumption. The
  model used here is to project forward the number of ASs found in the
  Internet's BGP table (advertised ASs), and also model the best fit
  projection of the ratio of unadvertised to advertised AS
  numbers. These two series will allow the projection of the total
  assigned AS numbers.  Together with a model of the behavior of the
  RIR AS number pool, a complete AS number consumption model can be
  generated. The modelling uses the most recent 800 days as the
  baseline data for this exercise.

  


  The first series is the projection of the unadvertised AS count /
  advertised AS count ratio.  This is shown in the following figure,
  with a linear best fit superimposed on the measured data.

  


Figure 22 - unadvertised / advertised AS Ratio best fit



  The next step is to model the advertised AS number count. The
  previous section looked at both linear and exponential trend
  models. This is shown in the figure below.

  


Figure 23 - Allocation Rate - linear and exponential trend best fit



  The most recent data and the correlation to the linear and best fit
  models is shown in the figure below.

  


Figure 24 - Allocation Rate - linear and exponential trend best fit




  The error between the original data series and the linear and
  exponential trend models is shown below. The closer the values in
  these series are to zero, the better the fit.

  


Figure 25 - Allocation Rate - linear and exponential trend error



  A best fit to the data can be established by looking at the
  first order differential of the data. If the first order
  differential is constant, then a linear trend model would be the
  best fit to the data. This is shown in the following figure.

  


Figure 26 - First order differential of allocation rate



  There is a rising trend in this data, indicating that an exponential model
  may be a better fit. here the first order differential of the log of the
  data is shown in the following figure.

  


Figure 27 - First order differential of log(allocation rate)



  Using this exponential trend model of advertised AS number growth
  and a linear trend model of the ratio of unadvertised to advertised
  AS numbers, it is now possible to model each RIR's projected AS
  allocation rate and then look at the predicted behaviour of the
  RIR pool size for each RIR. This is shown below.

  


Figure 28 - RIR Pool size - projection



  Using this model of each RIR's relative rate of allocation, it it
  possible to generate a model of AS number consumption. Here the end
  point is the date where the first RIR has exhausted its available
  pool of 2-byte AS numbers, and no further numbers are available in
  the IANA unallocated pool to replenish the RIR's pool. The data
  available suggests a best fit predictive model where this will occur
  on 09-Jan-2023.

  


Figure 29 - Predictive model of 2-Byte AS Number consumption

The imminent novel threat of Artificial General Intelligence has increased the urgency to prep by at least an order of magnitude, and has made past condsiderations by preppers in many ways obsolete.
While as of 2022, the AGI topic has gained some traction in the public sphere with ChatGPT, opinions as to how it will unfold vary wildly, and are often driven by first-guess fallacies, judging by the past and not the future, ignorance of exponential growth, herd mentality, blind faith in media and institutions, and illogical or non-existent threat assessments and threat policies. For a more detailed analysis of this situation, you can read the chapter “the threat”.
After you have read this chapter, you will come to understand that highly dangerous superhuman AI systems are feasible by 2024-2027, and that many individuals and shady corporate entities, will gain the power to wield them openly or covertly with a delay of maybe 2-4 years.
While it is true that positive outcomes are also likely, consider the following negative ones:
All those outcomes are very serious in nature, and cannot simply be answered with ignorance and willful disbelief by any reasonable person. The awesome powerful impact of AGI is undoubtful and will be absolutely unprecedented in history. It must be addressed with reasonable preparedness.
I hope to provide the bare essentials of prepping against the worst on this site, with the minimum amount of investment in both time and money (500-2000 Euros). If you are willing to spend 10000 Euros or more on prepping, this guide might not be the best for you.

                    On 17 November 2022, three men were found guilty of downing flight MH17 on 17 July 2014, resulting in the death of 298 persons on board. The court sentenced them to the highest penalty, life imprisonment. On 8 February 2023, the JIT announced its findings of the investigation into other persons involved. Although no further prosecutions were initiated, the case file will not be permanently closed.

                    War crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, torture and enforced disappearances: international crimes and offenses of the most serious sort. The Dutch government believes that such crimes must be investigated and the guilty parties brought to justice.

Proton VPN has a Secure Core feature that improves user privacy and data security by mitigating some of the risks from a compromised VPN server.
A common method to expose VPN traffic is to compromise the server that handles your traffic. This risk is particularly acute for servers located in high-risk jurisdictions. To mitigate this risk, Proton VPN has Secure Core servers. This article provides an overview of the attacks and threats that Secure Core mitigates, how it achieves higher VPN privacy, as well as instructions on how to activate Secure Core in Proton VPN.
Proton VPNâs unique Secure Core architecture allows us to protect our users from network attacks that other VPNs cannot defend against. A classic VPN setup involves a client passing traffic through a VPN server en-route to the final destination. If an attacker can get control of the VPN server, or monitor the network of the server, they will be able to match VPN clients with their traffic, nullifying the privacy benefits of the VPN.
Such timing/correlation attacks are not difficult to accomplish. In countries with restrictive Internet regulations (China, Russia, Iran, Turkey, etc.), or countries with broad surveillance powers (USA, UK, etc.), state surveillance agencies typically have the legal ability to coerce either the VPN provider, or the network/server provider of the VPN provider, to assist with such network monitoring. Therefore, even though Proton VPN is based in Switzerland, we cannot be certain that authorities are not monitoring our VPN servers located in those high-risk countries.
Secure Core allows us to defend against this threat to VPN privacy by passing user traffic through multiple servers. When you connect to a server in a high-risk jurisdiction like the US, your traffic will first go through our Secure Core servers. Therefore, even if an attacker monitors our servers in the US, they would only be able to follow the traffic back to the edge of our Secure Core network, thus making it far more difficult to discover the true IP address and location of Proton VPN users.
We have also gone to extraordinary lengths to defend our Secure Core servers. First, servers are located in countries selected specifically for their strong privacy laws (Iceland, Switzerland, and Sweden). We also placed our Secure Core servers in high-security data centers to ensure strong physical security. Proton VPN infrastructure in Sweden is housed in an underground data center, while our Iceland servers are on a former military base. Furthermore, Secure Core servers are wholly owned and provisioned by us (shipped on-site directly from our offices). Finally, Secure Core servers are connected to the Internet using our own dedicated network with IP addresses that are owned and operated by our own Local Internet Registry (LIR).
These measures provide us with a much higher level of certainty that no one has tampered with our Secure Core servers. While there is no such thing as 100% security, Secure Core is just one of the many ways Proton VPN delivers better security and privacy by protecting against complex attacks other VPNs cannot defend against.
Secure Core is a feature available on all paid Proton VPN plans and can be activated as follows:
1. Open the Proton VPN app, click on the Secure Core button, and select Secure Core On.

2. Select a country and click Connect to connect to it via one of our Secure Core servers. Alternatively, you can click the â¨ dropdown button next to a country and choose a Secure Core server to route your connection through.

Please note that not all countries can be connected to from all of our Secure Core locations.
1. Open the Proton VPN app and toggle the Secure Core switch on.

2. Tap on a country you wish the VPN to exit from, and then tap the on button next to the Secure Core country you want the connection to be routed through.

Please note that not all countries can be connected to from all of our Secure Core locations.
On our Linux app, Secure Core servers are currently are shown in the server list for each supported exit country. Secure Core servers have two Alpha -2 ISO country codes, signifying entry location-exit server.
For example, CH-LU#1 indicates a Secure Core server, where the entry sever is located in Switzerland and the exit server is LU#1 (located in Luxembourg).

rant
Today we launch RantSocial Radio, the first of a planned series of stations to offer continuous, curated media selected from the projectâs collection.
Right now, its content is simple:  12 hours of 154 hand-picked, Creative Commons-licensed tracks.  Most of them are already available in the public collection, and the remainder will be added in the next couple weeks.  In the meantime, nearly all of them can also be found with a quick search on the Internet Archive.
Questions, comments, requests, contributions, and any other feedback are always welcome.
We hope you enjoy it.

Total costs incurred by the RantSocial project:  $34.17
In the early summer of 2003, I was skimming Winampâs shiny new video stream directory and came across RantTV, playing the Burning Man episodes of SKTFM.TV.
That idle click 18 years ago changed the course of my life more than I can say - irreversibly tying me to music, aesthetics, design values, and a community of fellow weirdos.  My closest and longest-lasting friendships have been built on this common ground.
In the last decade, that community and the media it was built around has frayed at the seams, with parts lost to the churn of expiring servers and the trends of social media. Those values have been assailed more and more by corpolitical interests that constantly demonstrate their unsuitability as caretakers of our shared history.
We need better, and we can do better.
In 2019 (two years ago today) when the RantRadio and RantTV streams were shut down, it marked the end of what had been a stable presence my entire adult life.  I bought the domain and wrote out a plan for this project the next day.  With permission to proceed (and even slightly bend the âdonât call it Rantâ rule), Iâm excited to finally take it public.
Today, this is an ongoing archive of the free media that brought us together, and more that matches our tastes and interests.  Soon, it will hopefully develop into much more.
If you want to help, save a copy of the collection for yourself and stay in touch.  If you have something to say or show and the means to record it, consider making something new to add to our collection.
Thank you for being here.

    It's an average of 18 launch reviews for the Radeon VII (with appr. 1250 single benchmarks).
  

    Just counted average frame rates just at the Ultra HD (4K) resolution.
  

    The average performance is slightly weighted in favor of these reviews with more tests/benchmarks.
  

    Power drawn is the average of some measurements for the graphics card only.
  

Conclusion #1: The Radeon VII is (on average) +30.4% faster than the Radeon RX Vega 64 (little bit better as AMD's own benchmarks).
  

Conclusion #2: The Radeon VII is (on average) not perfectly on the same performance as the GeForce RTX 2080, but it's near enough. The GeForce RTX 2080 Ref. is just +3.9% faster, the GeForce RTX 2080 FE is +7.4% faster.
  

Conclusion #3: The Radeon VII have (on average) the same overall performance as the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. The Radeon VII wins some tests against the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, loose some tests, but the average it nearly perfect equal.
  

    The whole performance comparison R7 vs. 1080Ti vs. 2080-FE in one single picture.

TecnologÃ­a y sexo practican un vals cada vez mÃ¡s arrimado. Las consecuencias van desde la creaciÃ³n de nuevas formas de intimidad hasta adicciones crÃ­ticas o escenarios futuros de deshumanizaciÃ³n. Sea como fuere, la evoluciÃ³n sexual pasa por los circuitos y la electricidad.
Febrero es un mes torpe. Las ciudades parecen, con los cambios bruscos de temperatura, inmensos campos de investigaciÃ³n climÃ¡tica que ponen nuestra moral a prueba. De los dÃ­as castigados por el insolente gris, el frÃ­o y la lluvia machacona, saltamos a jornadas que se revelan primaverales, para las que no estÃ¡bamos preparados. Es un mes casero, autoindulgente por encima de sus posibilidades.
Si uno sobrevive a febrero, aguantarÃ¡ el resto del aÃ±oâ¦ O eso dice. Sin duda, una de las mejores formas de hacerlo es avivando la satisfacciÃ³n. La satisfacciÃ³n sexual, entiÃ©ndase. No por nada, hicimos del dÃ­a 14 de este extraÃ±o periodo la fecha de los enamorados. Una noche de encuentro lujurioso, donde abandonarse a los poderes de un deseo cada dÃ­a mÃ¡s auspiciado por la tecnologÃ­a.
Hace nada, hablÃ© de las novias IA y el escabroso asunto de su consentimiento frente a nuestros devaneos. En esta ocasiÃ³n, quisiera generalizar poniÃ©ndonos a nosotros, a los sujetos deseantes de impulso erÃ³tico en el centro de la reflexiÃ³n. Cosa que es muy nuestra. Muy humanaâ¦ Porque el erotismo es esa expediciÃ³n por los placeres y desplaceres del sexo, donde se topa uno con la dialÃ©ctica fÃ­sica y sensitiva de un partenaire. Ese extraÃ±o lugar en el que quienes protagonizan el diÃ¡logo se olvidan, no sÃ³lo del sexo como medio para la procreaciÃ³n, como dirÃ­a George Bataille, sino incluso de ellos mismos.
Poco importa el mes en el que nos encontremos, los cuatro impulsos primigenios y bÃ¡sicos que nos someten son alimentarnos, huir, luchar y follâ¦ alto, seamos profesionales; tener sexo. AsÃ­ lo diagnÃ³stico el neuropsicÃ³logo Karl H. Pribram, quien en 1958 puso a punto esa conclusiÃ³n sin saber que la tecnologÃ­a, en especial la digital, dispondrÃ­a a nuestro alcance las mayores facilidades para culminar, con creces y falta de esfuerzo, esas cuatro ineludibles propulsiones.
Â¿Acaso no disponemos de aplicaciones para pedir comida y transporte, foros iracundos y redes sociales donde empacharse a discutir y, bueno, millones de pÃ¡ginas donde regalarnos la vista con la sexualidad ajena, participar indirectamente de ella o, ya puestos, facilitar su encuentro en persona? Huelga decir, ya sÃ³lo por el creciente interÃ©s de la sociedad civil, de los medios de comunicaciÃ³n y los organismos pÃºblicos, que la masificaciÃ³n cotidiana de la pornografÃ­a digital se estÃ¡ poniendo en tela de juicio.
No por nada, el nuevo Reglamento europeo de Servicios Digitales ha decidido poner el foco sobre ella, cortÃ¡ndole las alas a la indomable industria porno. Esta estrategia normativa pretende parar la fÃ¡brica de erecciones online y su inminente obsesiÃ³n global de efectos en absoluto recomendables. Secuelas como hordas de tecnoadictos fetichistas de un tag pornogrÃ¡fico violento sin el que el orgasmo se vuelve imposible, o zombis aletargados que dependen del consumo regular de la silicona audiovisual, tan incÃ³moda como falsa, para alcanzar la dicha
Todos podemos tener mÃ¡s o menos claro que, independientemente de que el consumo de pornografÃ­a en ordenadores, smartphones, etcÃ©tera, represente el nexo destacado entre los transhumanos digitales en los que nos hemos convertido y la sexualidad, esto no encarna intimidad recÃ­proca alguna. Dejando de lado, por supuesto, el diminuto percentil de individuos que gozan de un consumo pornogrÃ¡fico en compaÃ±Ã­a y como material de estimulaciÃ³n compartido. En cambio, el asentamiento social al que han llegado las aplicaciones de citas como Tinder, Bumble y Grindr, si han hecho del entremÃ©s, de la primera toma de contacto antes de culminar en lo erÃ³tico, algo mediado por las mÃ¡quinas.
Y no sÃ³lo la previa al revolcÃ³n empieza a estar domesticada por la tecnologÃ­a, la cÃ³pula, el casquete en sÃ­, tambiÃ©n. De los desfasados anillos vibradores, hasta las versiones clÃ¡sica, Pro, Penguin, Masculina o Curvy del Satisfyer, los chismes han serpenteado Ã¡gilmente hasta conquistar el centro de la cama. Tenemos succionadores de clÃ­toris, sistemas de ondas de presiÃ³n, aparatos sin y con vibraciÃ³nâ¦ BÃ¡sicamente, a la siguiente generaciÃ³n de aparatos ya sÃ³lo le falta hacerte tortitas mientras te corres y llevar telÃ©fono incorporado para llamar a tu madre contÃ¡ndole la jugada. Porque lo que es Internet y Bluetooth, por ejemplo, ya lo tienen casi todos. Y eso, claro, dejando de lado a los robots sexuales (una excentricidad aÃºn mÃ¡s discreta en consumo que las Apple Vision Pro), y otras fÃ³rmulas elÃ©ctricas que pululan en el mercado.
Â¿Nos hemos transformado en pequeÃ±os cÃ­borgs sexuales? Separar nuestra sexualidad de la tecnologÃ­a comienza a tornarse complicado. Y ni siquiera hemos tenido que llegar a la temida singularidad. Sin habitar la mente humana (intermediarios fÃ­sicos aparte), en el universo virtual, ya estamos naturalizando los muchos gadgets existentes como una parte mÃ¡s del sexo. Al fin y al cabo, hace aÃ±os hablÃ¡bamos de âcitas por Internetâ para lo que actualmente son sencillamente citas. Y quienes usaban juguetes en el lecho para prodigarse carantoÃ±as orgiÃ¡sticas eran tomados por liberales desatados; carne de comuna hippie tecnoactualizada. Ahora se habla de parejas sanas.
Â¿Se ha convertido nuestra sexualidad en un brillante Ã¡rbol de navidad, plagado a sus faldas de los mÃ¡s variopintos regalos tecnolÃ³gicos sin los que la presencia del arbolito perderÃ­a el sentido? Â¿Hemos desarrollado cierta dependencia de elementos mecÃ¡nicos externos? Â¿QuiÃ©n es el mayor beneficiado de todo esto? Bueno, esperemos ser nosotros, Â¿quÃ© gracia tendrÃ­a haber peleado por la liberaciÃ³n sexual, para pasar a ser esclavos de otros amos?
Laura, estudiante de Ciencias de la InformaciÃ³n que pidiÃ³ ser identificada sÃ³lo por su nombre, afirma no reflexionar mucho sobre ello: âNos pasamos el dÃ­a pegados al mÃ³vil, o con el ordenador, usar algo tecnolÃ³gico en la cama no se me hace raro. En el caso del Satisfyer, sÃ­ que me he encontrado con chicos a los que no les gustaba. Se sentÃ­an comoâ¦ sustituidos. Pero, como soy de la generaciÃ³n Z, supongo que me resulta mÃ¡s normalâ. Pero la tecnologÃ­a puede ser un arma de doble filo. Se habla reiteradamente de una bajada de la actividad sexual en la juventud.
La revista, The Atlantic, en un profuso reportaje, trata este descenso como una ârecesiÃ³n sexualâ en toda regla, extendida por los paÃ­ses desarrollados, y la empresa Control destaca que, en EspaÃ±a, el 64% de los jÃ³venes tiene, como mucho, una relaciÃ³n sexual semanal. Los motivos son de lo mÃ¡s diversos; desde la presiÃ³n de las redes sociales, el desinterÃ©s a tenor de la atenciÃ³n que acapara la oferta de ocio existente, el alto consumo de pornografÃ­a o a la multitud de herramientas mÃ¡s prÃ¡cticas que la interacciÃ³n humana. Algo sobre lo que Laura dice: âAhÃ­ no me mojo, porque no tengo datosâ.
La experta en salud y bienestar sexual en EspaÃ±a de las marcas de Lovehoney Group, Ana LombardÃ­a, preguntada al respecto, opina: âCreo que la tecnologÃ­a no nos hace mÃ¡s o menos sexuales, sino que cambia nuestra sexualidad. El ser sexuales es algo propio de la naturaleza humana, y la tecnologÃ­a no aumenta o disminuye eso. Lo que sÃ­ que creo es que la tecnologÃ­a a veces nos distancia del resto de personas, mÃ¡s que unirnos, si las utilizamos mal. La tecnologÃ­a deberÃ­a servirnos para facilitarnos el contacto en persona y construir vÃ­nculos, no para mantener una conexiÃ³n irreal que se sostiene y mantiene Ãºnicamente a travÃ©s de la pantalla… o que fomenta un modelo de vÃ­nculo que no es aplicable en la vida realâ.
Pero Â¿no serÃ¡ ese uno de los espurios objetivos, quizÃ¡s no directos, pero seguro bien hallados, del mercado de la tecnologÃ­a sexual? Identificar los escollos dentro de la industria y las demandas del consumidor es una de las dinÃ¡micas mÃ¡s diseminadas empresarialmente. No sÃ³lo produciendo material de âjuegoâ cada vez mejor, sino navegando las pantanosas aguas de la inteligencia artificial y la realidad virtual, materializando asÃ­ la extraÃ±a pesadilla de un reemplazo de los humanos.  
En este sentido, LombardÃ­a afirma: âLa tecnologÃ­a puede hacer que todo sea mucho mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil, rÃ¡pido y sin complicaciones: el porno o la IA son claros ejemplos de la tecnologÃ­a al servicio del placer de una manera controvertida, pues simplifican mucho el proceso, crean un tipo de sexualidad que no es realista, cuyas normas no sirven lejos de las pantallas. Eso es algo que debemos aprender a manejar y limitar para no pervertir la sexualidad. Esta simplificaciÃ³n de los procesos puede generar habituaciÃ³n, es decir, que no disfrutemos sin pornografÃ­a o IA de por medio, e incluso dependencia. Si nos habituamos a los estÃ­mulos muy fÃ¡ciles, rÃ¡pidos, en los que no tenemos que interactuar o que las interacciones no responden a procesos de vÃ­nculos humanos reales, nuestro cuerpo y cerebro se vuelven âcÃ³modosâ, y luego cuesta mÃ¡s disfrutar. Es como el alcohol: yo puedo salir de fiesta y emborracharme con cuatro copas, pero si estoy habituado a consumir alcohol, necesitarÃ© ocho para notar el efecto de la embriaguez, perder el control, soltarme y desinhibirme, pasÃ¡rmelo bienâ.
Esto me recuerda, paralelamente, a la prÃ¡ctica del BDSM. Una modalidad sexual que no ha parado de crecer desde los aÃ±os 90, convirtiÃ©ndose en una actividad promocionada incluso por pelÃ­culas mainstream, y, hasta cierto punto, normalizada. Sin embargo, muchos advierten del torbellino en el que uno entra cuando pone en prÃ¡ctica un ejercicio tan extremo de satisfacciÃ³n fetichista. MÃ¡s o menos, la misma adicciÃ³n de la que se habla con la pornografÃ­a y demÃ¡s.
La dueÃ±a y gestora de un club de BDSM en Barcelona Aries Sosa tiene antes en cuenta la sensaciÃ³n de realizaciÃ³n de estas prÃ¡cticas, que su posible dependencia: âLas personas estÃ¡n la mayor parte del tiempo coartadas. Muchas necesitan de una liberaciÃ³n, bien sea sumisa o dominante, para experimentar placeres a los que, de otra forma, no accederÃ­an. Â¿Puede haber quien, una vez descubiertas estas prÃ¡cticas, tenga dificultades con el sexo conservador? SÃ­, claro. Pero eso serÃ­a como decir que alguien por probar otra posiciÃ³n que no sea el misionero, va a estar impedido de ponerlo normalmente en prÃ¡ctica. La clave es convertir esto en un placer aÃ±adidoâ.
Laura matiza: âNo sÃ© si compararÃ­a el BDSM con la pornografÃ­a o el uso de juguetes sexuales. El porno o los juguetes, aunque los puedas disfrutar en compaÃ±Ã­a, suelen ser cosas mÃ¡s individuales. Eso, supongo, puede crear mÃ¡s adicciÃ³nâ¦ Con el BDSM, o tienes a otra persona que acceda, o no sÃ© quÃ© opciones te quedan. Imagino que hay mÃ¡s interacciÃ³n humanaâ.
Lo que queda patente es que, en el punto medio, en el equilibrio, se encuentra un lugar comÃºn. La tecnologÃ­a, como el sexo, las drogas y hasta la bollerÃ­a, en dosis controladas, satisface, pero azuzada, la dependencia se vuelve peligrosa.
En esta lÃ­nea, Felipe Rico, un joven desarrollador de big data e inteligencia artificial, considera: âCualquier herramienta que la tecnologÃ­a proporciona al ser humano, si es usada con criterio y mesura, puede ser muy beneficiosa, y puede llegar a traducirse en un impacto positivo en el individuo, y un avance significativo a nivel social. Mientras que, si las nuevas tecnologÃ­as se emplean como parece que suele hacer la mayorÃ­a durante los Ãºltimos tiempos, con un uso abusivo de ellas y haciÃ©ndose dependientes en variedad de facetas, tanto cotidianas como extraordinarias, considero puede repercutir de forma negativa, especialmente en tÃ©rminos sociales, encaminando a la poblaciÃ³n humana a un nuevo nivel de hermetismo, deshumanizaciÃ³n y desvinculaciÃ³n del grupoâ.
Y no es baladÃ­ hablar de hermetismo y deshumanizaciÃ³n, pues si vemos que algo tan intrÃ­nseco a la condiciÃ³n humana como el sexo queda sometido a gastos sensoriales hiperestimulantes, la lÃ­nea entre lo real y lo ficticio puede ir difuminÃ¡ndose insalvablemente, con consecuencias como la ya citada bajada en el porcentaje de relaciones sexuales.
No obstante, si abrimos el angular, y tomamos perspectiva, quizÃ¡s las nuevas generaciones pongan menos en prÃ¡ctica la actividad sexual carnal, pero, sin duda, gozan de una intimidad virtual (mensajes de texto, videollamadas, etcÃ©tera) impensable para generaciones pasadas. Si bien la sexualidad en persona decae, la sexualidad mediada se eleva. Y, por lo tanto, no nos deshumanizamos, sino que readaptamos nuestros impulsos naturales.
Sosa concluye: âEl sexo es un territorio de exploraciÃ³n. Un lugar donde jugar, experimentar, ser originales y estimularnos de cualquier forma que se nos ocurra. Por supuesto, siempre poniendo el consentimiento en el centro. Si mÃ¡s personas se dejasen llevar por el BDSM y conocieran la red que tenemos creada alrededor, habrÃ­a muchas menos frustraciones sociales y, con total seguridad, menos violencia sexualâ.
En definitiva, habernos convertido en pequeÃ±os cÃ­borgs sexuales quizÃ¡s sea, sencillamente, un paso mÃ¡s en nuestra evoluciÃ³n. Bien por un apetito desatado enfocado en la novedad y los estÃ­mulos (en vista de que nuestra supervivencia estÃ¡, relativamente, a salvo), bien porque participamos de una ociosidad incansable o, sencillamente, porque nos aburrimos con facilidad, el vals entre tecnologÃ­a y sexo es parte de nuestro presente. Ahora, como de costumbre, sabe Dios lo que nos depararÃ¡ el futuroâ¦

O
n an August  night in 2003, a young woman who went by the name Paulina sank into the sofa of her modest, rented apartment, opened up her laptop, and began talking about sex with a man she’d recently met in a Yahoo chat group. His name was Stephen Bolen. His first communications had been terse, but he soon warmed to Paulina. It didn’t take long for both of them to begin to open up. 

	Paulina had told Bolen she lived in the Atlanta area, that she had a three-year-old daughter, that her daughter’s father was no longer in the picture. Soon, she was sharing more intimate details: what it was like growing up a skinny white girl in a rough neighborhood outside of D.C.; how her dad, a Marine, had died by suicide two weeks before she was born; how her mom had been emotionally and physically abusive, and had never really shown her love. How she’d had a sexual relationship with her stepfather.

	Paulina would put her daughter to bed and then she and Bolen would chat throughout the night, over Yahoo and sometimes on the phone. The back-and-forth could feel like dating, but with an added element of danger and risk: Both Paulina and Bolen knew they were tiptoeing up to a line to see if they trusted each other enough to cross it. It could take a while to figure that out.



	Eventually, Bolen asked Paulina to send pictures of her daughter, and she agreed to do so, though the ones she’d shared were chaste — the little girl clothed and her face turned away from the camera or obscured behind an untamable halo of blond curls. After seeing the pictures, Bolen asked to meet. While a lot of the men Paulina had encountered in chatrooms like “Sex With Younger” just wanted to trade images and videos of children, to expand their illicit collections, Bolen was a “traveler,” someone looking to act upon his obsessions. 



	On Sept. 17, just as they’d arranged, Paulina sat on a bench outside Perimeter Mall with a stroller parked in front of her, scanning the parking lot nervously. Part of her hoped Bolen wouldn’t show. When he did, she could see he was handsome, a preppy guy in a pink polo shirt and khakis. “Paulina?” he asked eagerly. She nodded. As he smiled and pulled back the blanket draped across the stroller, he found himself surrounded, handcuffs slipped around his wrists.

	“Paulina” watched his face fall, his confusion giving way to distress as FBI agents took him into custody. It was her first undercover arrest. It would be the first of many.

	if one wanted to hide in plain sight, one could do no better than the tidy, suburban neighborhood on the outskirts of St. Louis, where FBI Special Agent Nikki Badolato now resides. The well-tended, two-story homes are so pleasantly indistinct that I could hardly tell you what hers looks like, even if it were safe for me to do so, which it is not. Suffice to say that Midwestern comfort and conformity unspool around every gently winding curve. Here Badolato has raised her two children, a daughter who is now in college and a son who is a junior at a local high school. When planning a neighborhood scavenger hunt or tending the community garden, Badolato does not often mention her many years as head of the Child Exploitation Task Force, a joint effort between the feds and local law enforcement that targets some of the country’s most heinous crimes. Open a cabinet in her kitchen, however, and a government-issued Glock 42 can be found stowed away between the vitamins and mixing bowls. 



	On a sunny morning this past October, Badolato sat at her dining room table, scrapbooks and albums spread out before her on the dark wood. There was the acceptance letter she’d received from the bureau the spring of her senior year of high school, after a representative had shown up to administer a test in the typewriting room. “I chose to wear a red dress and red heels,” she says of her first day as an FBI mail clerk, two weeks after her 18th birthday. “I don’t know what the hell I was thinking. I guess maybe I was trying to go in bold?” She pauses at a picture of herself on the gun range at Quantico almost 10 years later, her shoulders squared and her caramel hair pulled back into a ponytail as she fires off rounds. By then, she’d married a man she met just after high school, had a little girl, completed college at night, and been accepted into agent training in the heady days after 9/11. She’d seen her first dead body only a few weeks into the job, after the pursuit of a bank robber ended with a shootout in a Walmart. When Badolato got to the scene, the body was still warm, and the perp’s head was resting on a bag of cookies. “It was surreal,” she says. “How many times have you been in a Walmart and walked down Aisle 4, not really expecting there to be a dead person with his head lying on a bag of Chips Ahoy?”

	Badolato wasn’t deterred. She felt like the bureau saved her, plucked her out of a shitty home life, and gave her prospects and purpose. As a new agent, she was intent on proving herself worthy. “My training agent told me, ‘You know, Nikki, it’s a marathon, not a sprint,’ ” she says. “I was like, ‘That’s ridiculous. I don’t even know what that’s supposed to mean.’ ” She turned a few pages to show a picture of the 391 kilos of cocaine and 140 pounds of meth she’d recovered on a single raid during a stint with a cartel squad, then pointed out another in which she poses with a five-year-old child she’d rescued, the little girl’s hair cut short because the kidnapper had wanted her to look like a boy. But the keepsake she really wants to find is the card that Bolen’s wife had pressed into her hand at his sentencing, the one with the picture of their children — a blond girl of about three years and a tiny baby — and the words “These are the faces of the children you protect each day.” Bolen’s wife had been the only one she’d ever encountered who had lobbied for her husband to receive the maximum sentence. Some wives accused the FBI of planting evidence inside computers. Most seemed intent on clinging to their delusions. (Attempts to reach Bolen for comment were unsuccessful.)



	Which, Badolato has come to understand, is the way it goes with child trafficking and sexual abuse. She had invited me into her home — had agreed to speak on the record about her decades-long career working undercover — because when it comes to the crimes she’s spent her career fighting, she has had enough of the delusions people are under. She’s had enough of the way movies like Sound of Freedom both glamorize and trivialize the work she and her colleagues do, enough of the idea that swashbuckling white men burst through doors and rescue trafficked children with a Bible in one hand and a firearm in the other, enough of conspiracy theories about Hollywood and Washington that detract from the real root causes of why children are trafficked and abused. “Human trafficking is not the movie Pretty Woman — the girl doesn’t get the guy — and it’s not the movie Taken, where people are kidnapped in a foreign country and sold on the black market, or shipped in a container across the world,” one of the detectives who worked on Badolato’s task force tells me. “I’m not saying that doesn’t ever happen, but it’s not what we’re seeing.”
“Right now some little girl is being dropped off in the parking lot of a motel,” Badolato says. “There are four girls holed up in a hotel next to a McDonald’s. It is happening all the time.”

	What they are seeing is a lot more insidious and a lot more homegrown. A report released in 2018 by the State Department ranked the U.S. as one of the worst countries in the world for human trafficking. While the Department of Justice has estimated that between 14,500 and 17,500 foreign nationals are trafficked into this country every year, this number pales in comparison to the number of American minors who are trafficked within it: A 2009 Department of Health and Human Services review of human trafficking into and within the United States found that roughly 199,000 American minors are sexually exploited each year, and that between 244,000 and 325,000 American youths are considered to be at risk of being trafficked specifically in the sex industry. Heartbreakingly, many of these children are victimized not by strangers who’ve abducted them from mall parking lots but rather by people they know and trust: Studies have found that as much as 44 percent of victims are trafficked by family members, most often parents (and not infrequently parents who were trafficked themselves). Between 2011 and 2020, there was an 84 percent increase in the number of people prosecuted for a federal human-trafficking offense. Of the defendants charged in 2020, 92 percent were male, 63 percent were white, 66 percent had no prior convictions, and 95 percent were U.S. citizens. 

	Badolato started her career as an FBI agent in some of the earliest days that children could be bought, sold, and traded online. As the internet-porn industry mushroomed, its most lucrative branch turned out to be that of child sexual-abuse materials (the term “child pornography” is no longer used by those in the field, as it implies consent). And as demand for these images increased, so did the abuse that led to their creation.



	In 2003, just a few months after Badolato graduated from Quantico, a Crimes Against Children squad was formed in the Atlanta office where she’d been stationed. By then, the FBI was starting to get a handle on the extent of the problem — if not exactly what to do about it. At a weeklong training in Baltimore, Badolato was given a tour of the darkest underbelly of fetish chat groups and then instructed to figure out how to infiltrate. “Everyone was a little nervous,” she explains of the directive. “It was a process, a direction that was new.” Agents were told that they would need to come up with a “persona” and a “story,” and that they would likely have to provide images of children to “prove” they had a minor on offer. They were also told that they could use images of their own children, if they were comfortable doing so (the FBI no longer endorses this policy). 

	Badolato developed “Paulina” based on her understanding that any persona would need to share most of her own backstory and traits. “That’s the only way you can really do undercover work,” Badolato says. “People can tell the sincerity in what you’re saying, so there has to be a level of genuineness, but then you just add this criminal element to it.” Most of the things Badolato had told Bolen were true: where she was from, her family background, the monstrousness of her mother, a woman who she says would pass out cigarettes and beers to Badolato’s 13-year-old friends in a state of manic permissiveness one minute and fly into a violent rage about a piece of lint on the floor the next. (Badolato’s mother declined to comment for this article, but a childhood friend corroborated Badolato’s account.) It was true that growing up in an unstable home with a string of stepdads, she had never really felt loved, true that she had divorced her first husband, true that she was raising their three-year-old daughter on her own. The only thing that wasn’t true was her tale of being molested, her initiation into the “lifestyle” — to use the chatroom parlance — that Paulina said she now wanted for her daughter. As Badolato had familiarized herself with the language and behaviors of the chatrooms, she’d honed that added criminal element, imagining what psychological conditions might believably lead a parent to traffic their own child and how those conditions could be grafted onto her real life story. She already had a history of abuse; it was not hard to extrapolate to a fictional stepfather who had seemed to provide a gentle counterpoint, showing her love and making her feel special when no one else had, even if others couldn’t understand. From there, it was easy to convince the chatroom participants that she shared their belief — or justification — that most people had it all wrong and that “child love” was natural, and could even be beneficial for the child. 

	Badolato estimates that she has arrested more than a thousand people; not one of those arrests has failed to end in a conviction. She didn’t know until she was in the thick of it that most agents refuse this sort of work, that most can’t even pretend to forge a relationship with someone looking to victimize a child. But she could. “Paulina,” she points out, is not a name she chose at random; it’s similar to her own mother’s name. Badolato says she had grown up learning to compartmentalize for the sake of her own emotional survival. She’d perfected the art of engaging with someone whose actions she couldn’t stand. Doing this work had felt like a way of taking her trauma and putting it to good use, of leveraging her past as a safeguard against her daughter’s and other children’s futures. 



	Of course there were moments that were hard to take — when suspects mentioned which brands of lubrication were best or whether or not a parent might hold a child down. There were times when she knew that even talking about these things was a turn-on for these men, times when the conversations made her nauseous, times when she’d lie awake all night or play back a recording and think, “Holy shit, I listened to this? I said these words?” But she kept faith in the mission. She reminded herself that the pictures she sent of her daughter — the beautiful, little girl sleeping in the next room — did not represent a real child on offer. “I was thinking, ‘If I send this obscure picture of my daughter and he acts on it, then he’s never going to harm my daughter or anybody else’s,’ ” Badolato says now. “I was presenting a fake girl to save a real one.” 

Kyle Parks seemed to think he could get away with anything. He seemed to think, for instance, that he could get away with running a brothel, a 1-900 sex line, and a housecleaning company out of the same Columbus, Ohio, office park and under the same oxymoronic name, XXXREC and Hygiene Services. He seemed to think he could invite one young woman and five teenagers (four of whom he had only just met) on a road trip to Florida, but instead deposit them in two rooms of a Red Roof Inn in St. Charles, Missouri. When they piled out of the minivan — high on the drugs he’d given them — saw snow falling and asked to be taken home, he thought he could make a little money off them first. All it took was a few ads in Backpage — the Craigslist of sex advertisements — and men began showing up.

	Even after things started going south for him, Parks couldn’t fathom that he wouldn’t prevail. When someone alerted law enforcement as to what was going on, Parks (who, according to legal documents, had been out getting food when the police showed up) burst into the precinct the next morning looking to bail his “friend” out. When questioned about the 88 condoms found in the back of his van, he said they had been prescribed to him by a doctor. After being taken into custody, he protested that he was being set up. Most people would have cut their losses and pleaded guilty, but not Parks. He thought he could take his case to court and win.



	And it wasn’t impossible to imagine that he might. Badolato knew that even the tightest cases could go sideways when put before 12 people who would inevitably enter the courtroom with a cinematic sense of what sex trafficking was supposed to be. In fact, it wasn’t just the jury that Badolato knew she would need to convince; it was also often the victims themselves, young people who had internalized the exact same misconceptions about trafficking that the jury had — along with any number of other judgments society had thrown their way — and who were loath to submit themselves to a courtroom full of more judgment.

	Of all of Parks’ underage victims, the hardest to pin down had been a 17-year-old we’ll call Sierra. Once she returned to Columbus, Sierra seemed to basically disappear. Calls to her mother’s number went unanswered. When one of the other victims managed to track her down in December 2016, a month before the case was to go to trial, Sierra agreed to meet Badolato on a blighted Columbus block with a string of dilapidated homes, climbing into the bureau’s Chevy Malibu with matted hair, dirty clothes, and a wary expression.

	By this time, Badolato had remarried, had a second child, relocated to St. Louis, and taken over as head of the Child Exploitation Joint Task Force, which had become one of the most productive FBI teams in the country in terms of arrests and convictions. Meanwhile, as the internet streamlined the process of buying or selling any good or service, trafficking had become one of the fastest-growing criminal enterprises, estimated by the Department of Homeland Security to bring in $150 billion globally and considered by many criminals to be a superior business model: If caught, the sentences were often lighter than those for peddling drugs; and unlike crack or heroin, the same product could be “used” again and again and again.

	Badolato taught her team of 20 how to do the online undercover work she’d trailblazed in Atlanta, tracking the movements of child-abuse material through the online underworld and then prosecuting those who distributed and produced it. Her new squad also initiated her in the type of undercover work it had been doing before her arrival: covert sting operations in which a detective would pose as a john, set up a “date,” and then meet said date in a hotel room fitted out with hidden recording devices while, in the next room over, a task-force team listened in, waiting for the code word that would let them know that enough evidence had been gathered for them to swoop in and shut the op down. This had proved a very effective technique for getting convictions, but Badolato’s arrival coincided with both a growing sentiment that consensual sex work had been over-criminalized and an increasing awareness that what looked like consensual sex work might actually be trafficking, no matter what the “date” professed in that hotel room. 



	Badolato has a tendency to say aloud the things she notices — about you, about others, about situations — observations that are not at all unkind but are perceptive enough that most people would keep them to themselves. She points out when someone deflects, and she has a sharp eye for defense mechanisms. She once casually mentions my tendency to mirror other people’s vocal and speech patterns. She is not shy about bringing up the emotional and physical abuse she says she experienced as a child, and she is quick to comment when someone is making excuses for someone else’s behavior. It was soon clear to her colleagues that Badolato brought a trauma-informed mentality to the work, a tendency to look beyond what someone was doing and instead try to parse why they were doing it. And she was relentless: While some squads did one or two trafficking sting ops a year, her team was doing four or five a month. In addition to the hotel rooms reserved for the john and the team, they would have a social worker set up in a third room, ready to offer services to the victims. They would have lookouts stationed to see who might be dropping the date off. If that date was found to be underage, the case was automatically classified as trafficking. But even if they weren’t, Badolato’s team was primed to get to the bottom of what was going on, to figure out whether they were being manipulated or coerced, and by whom. 

	“If I could put my hands on a pimp, that’s what I wanted,” says Jeff Roediger, a St. Louis county detective who was the “john” for many of Badolato’s sting ops and who makes clear that the team was not interested in policing voluntary sex work. “When I had those types of cases, and I knew they were being sincere with me, I wouldn’t book them,” he says. “It was all about talking to the girls. It’s not like in the movies where they come running to you. You know, ‘Thanks, you rescued me!’ It’s not like that. A lot of them try to bullshit you at first — ‘That’s my boyfriend, blah blah blah’— but once I talked to them for a while, they would become more forthcoming.” 



	Badolato’s unit was one of the first in the country to take on this “progressive and proactive” approach, as she puts it. Soon, St. Louis looked like a sex-trafficking capital — not because it was actually trafficking more victims than other cities but because the task force was so aggressively pursuing those cases, and classifying them as what they were. “I mean, I was working in vice for years,” says Roediger. “Back in the day, it was always ‘prostitution,’ ‘prostitution,’ ‘prostitution’ — until we started to figure it out a little bit, until we started digging a little deeper.” 

	Once they did, the task force found that roughly a third of the sex-trafficking victims they recovered were under the age of 17 — and they began to see the reach of the problem. Kids were being trafficked out of every hotel in the area, from the seediest roach motel to the fanciest Ritz-Carlton. They were being trafficked every time of day and by every socioeconomic group (“Before you go do brain surgery, you got to bust a nut real quick,” one underage victim told Badolato of her high-end clientele). Some of the victims were girls. Some were boys. Some were LGBTQ kids who’d been kicked out of their homes. Some were straight cis kids from the suburbs. “I tell people that I could probably name two or three [kids] in the school district they live in that have been trafficked,” Roediger says. “And they just can’t comprehend it.”

	There were kids who were about to age out of foster care (a particularly at-risk group, according to those who work in the field), kids who’d run away, kids who were being sold to pay their family’s rent, or to buy their family member’s drugs. There were kids who’d sit in the hotel room, backpack at their feet, dutifully working on their math homework while agents and social workers tried to figure out what to do with them. Was their home life safe enough that they could be returned to it? Would a residential program take them? Of all the imperfect options, which would make them least likely to be trafficked again?



	The one common denominator was this: They all had a vulnerability that could be preyed upon. They all lacked a safety net — societal, familial, emotional, or some combination thereof — that might have broken their fall. Mostly, their stories weren’t dramatic; they were typical American tales of neglect, of abuse doled out casually, of a steady stream of letdowns by people and institutions who should have propped them up. Badolato found that she had a knack for getting them to talk about this, for getting them to open up to her. She didn’t look like an FBI agent — at least not what they’d imagined. She spoke softly, but with authority and a slight vocal fry. And she thinks that, at some level, they could probably sense that she’d once been a vulnerable kid too, that with only a few slightly different twists of fate, she could have become a trafficking victim herself — and that she knew it. “My trauma looks different than theirs, but it’s trauma nonetheless,” she says. “And I think victims can feel that.”

As the task force learned more about the psychology of victims, they also learned more about the ways in which their vulnerability was being manipulated, and how those ways were evolving. It was known in law-enforcement circles that once a skilled trafficker set his or her sights on a vulnerable young person, they could be groomed in a matter of days: one day for an introduction, a day or two to make the victim feel special and cared for, and then the day when a “friend” comes over and he needs to be “cared for” as well. Sometimes violence was involved at that point; sometimes drug use was involved throughout. But emotional manipulation was the key element, which is why it was so easy for grooming to move online, for groomers to take advantage of the false senses of connection fostered on social media. 

	Of the victims who are not being trafficked by family members, the majority are being groomed in this way. “I would say that probably 75 percent of the initial grooming is happening online now,” says Cindy Malott, the director of U.S. Safe Programs at Crisis Aid International. “Recruiters used to have to work really, really hard to get access to kids, but now they’re practically sitting in a child’s bedroom. And kids put everything out there — what’s going on in their life, who they’re angry about, parents are going through a divorce, their insecurities about their body, about themselves, what they do, how they spend their time — so it’s like a gift to these predators.” 



	The ways to manipulate are legion: Get a kid to send a compromising photo, and she’ll do almost anything to keep you from sending it out to all her Facebook friends; find out a gay kid is still closeted, and the threat of outing him gives you incredible power. And predators aren’t just on Instagram and Snapchat; they lurk in the chat functions of Roblox, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto. “They’re everywhere,” says Malott. “People think, ‘Oh, I just got to keep my kids away from those porn sites, those horrible places.’ Well, no, predators are gonna go where the kids are.” And once there, they’re going to zero in on the kids who are most vulnerable.

	That’s what got to Badolato. In her online undercover work, she’d plumbed the psychology of pedophiles, but now she wasn’t just dealing with suspects; she was spending time with victims and seeing the same vulnerabilities in them that the traffickers had seen: the instability or poverty, the addiction or mental health issues or abuse that had been normalized in their lives long before the traffickers entered them. Sometimes Badolato couldn’t help but feel that all the conspiracies and misconceptions weren’t just a distraction from the truth of trafficking but rather some sick attempt to let society off the hook for trying to solve the much more intractable problems at trafficking’s root. “People would rather stick their head in the sand than address the real problem, because then you have to face and talk about the societal issues,” she says. “With a movie like Sound of Freedom, it’s like, ‘Oh, this is in a jungle in South America. This isn’t actually in [my neighborhood].’ You know? It’s easier for people to ignore the problem than deal with the issues on a societal level.”

By the time Badolato was sitting in that Chevy with Sierra, on that blighted Ohio block, she knew that the rate of re-victimization for children who are trafficked was as high as 95 percent, according to FBI reports. She knew that 90 percent of sex-trafficking victims have a history of child sexual abuse, that more than 75 percent had lived in foster or adoptive care. She knew that she could arrest one perpetrator, and another would pop up in his place, that she could send one pimp to prison and the same victims would show up to stings some short time later, run by a different crew. She knew that testifying was a way for Sierra to psychologically push back against what had happened to her, and she was right: After the young woman took the stand on Jan. 10, 2017, Parks was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years; while testifying, Sierra had seemed to transform, to channel and embody a sort of empowerment. But Badolato also knew that once her testimony was over, Sierra would go back to that blighted block. She wondered how long that empowerment would last.



	She also wondered about her own trajectory, her own ability to continue doing this work. The youngest trafficking victim she’d ever recovered from a sting op — an 11-year-old who’d been recruited through Facebook — had been returned to her family in a house that had no heat (Badolato had used an FBI slush fund to get it turned back on). One did not become immune to the human misery of such things. They compounded, became harder and harder to compartmentalize. “It’s just a combination of all of those years — and it’s all awful,” she says. “But there are particular moments that, for one reason or another, you can’t get out of your head. I just don’t think it’s in human nature to be exposed to that for so long and it not start changing who you are.” 

	One night, at a restaurant near where Badolato lives, I ask her whether she thinks children are being sex-trafficked right then, in that very moment, in just the mile or two radius around us. She’s quiet for a long time, her gaze fixed downward at her glass of wine. By the time she looks up, her whole body is trembling. “It’s happening right now,” she says quietly. “Right now some little girl is being dropped off in the parking lot of a motel. There are three or four girls holed up in a hotel next to a McDonald’s. It’s not only when we think about it. It is happening all the time. And if I’m just sitting here, present, having dinner, not thinking about it, that means I’m ignoring a problem that I know is real.” Tears stream down her face. 

	“Many images have never left my mind,” she says. “It’s really hard to have worked your entire life in law enforcement with a lot of child crime victims and be at the end of your career looking at the situation where you realize you can only do so much to make a difference.” Badolato wipes back the tears with the palm of her hand and shudders her head, as if she can shake the thoughts away. “Damn,” she says. “Fuck. I shouldn’t be the one crying. I’m not the victim of this.” The veteran agent steels herself and repeats, “I am not the victim.”



The house where Korina Ellison says she was first sex-trafficked no longer exists. It once stood on an unassuming lot in a residential suburb of Portland, Oregon, that stumbles down to the banks of the Willamette River. Now, Ellison can’t quite bring the house’s features to mind. She was so young back then, maybe four or five. There is so much she’s repressed, or only pieced together after the fact. As a child, she wouldn’t have known what she now believes to be true: that her grandmother scored her drugs by offering up her youngest daughter, Ellison’s mom. Or that, once her mom was hooked on the meth cooked by the man who’d lived in that house, she’d known just what to do to get more. But Ellison does remember being inside the house, unclothed. She does remember how the man would touch her.

	Her life unspooled from there. Her father died of a heroin overdose when she was six. Her mom lost custody for good. She bounced around foster care, then various residential institutions, then whatever shelter she could find. In the story she tells of how she was sex-trafficked again in her teenage years, there’s no moment of drama, no kidnapping, no clear coercion. There was just a random, rainy afternoon when she had no place to go and was alone in the street and a car pulled up. The man inside took her home with him, fed her, introduced her to his girlfriend. They took her shopping. They let her stay. When men showed up at the home to have sex with the woman, Ellison was invited to watch, but she wasn’t expected to participate — not at first, anyway. According to a statement Ellison later made to law enforcement, she just “realized that people aren’t going to take care of [me] for free.” Soon, the woman was posting Ellison’s services on Backpage — $150 for half an hour, $200 for a full one — and the trio were traveling the Midwest. For a long time, it didn’t even occur to Ellison, then 16, to leave. “Where would I have gone?” she asks. “I’d been missing for over a year. Nobody was looking for me.” When the man told her to call him “Daddy,” she complied. 

	That was more than a decade ago, near the beginning of Badolato’s tenure as head of the Child Exploitation Task Force. But by 2021, leaving it had seemed a necessary form of self-preservation. One of her last cases had gone well legally: The perp, a retired police officer from California who had produced child sex-abuse materials of three sisters in Manila, had pleaded guilty to such charges when he learned that Badolato had brought the girls to the states to testify against him. But the experience had been emotionally devastating for Badolato, who had wanted the sisters, then 16, 13, and 11, to have memories of the U.S that consisted of more than reliving their trauma in a courtroom. She took them shopping and to the zoo, invited them to her home to have dinner with her own family, saw them slowly start to open up and laugh and behave like the children they were. Then she’d had to put them on a flight back to Manila, back to the aunt who had allowed the man to abuse them and who Badolato had been unable to extradite. Fortunately, she says, their estranged father ended up intervening and taking custody of the girls, but that feeling of futility in the fight lingered.


“If I can be perfectly honest,” Badolato says, “I truly don’t believe that the FBI realizes what they put their agents through doing that kind of work.”

	“I stayed for a little bit longer after that trial, but it really was when I should have been able to look myself in the mirror and say, ‘Nikki, you’re done,’ ” Badolato had told me in St. Louis. “It became clear that I had been doing it too long.” She’d spend the last couple of years working national security, a position without the immediacy of child-exploitation work, but also without the heartache. “If I can be perfectly honest, I truly don’t believe that the FBI realizes what they put their agents through doing that kind of work. I just don’t,” she says.

	And yet, here Badolato was in Portland, leading Ellison, now 30, up to her hotel room, telling her about all the announcements she’d heard in the Atlanta airport instructing travelers to be on the lookout for sex trafficking. “It’s like white noise in the background,” she says as Ellison settles into the sofa. “It’s a false sense of doing something to help.”

	“Here’s the thing: Nobody knows what to look for,” Ellison agrees.

	“And what about the victims who are in that airport, who are walking around and listening?” Badolato asks.



	“I wouldn’t have even heard that announcement,” Ellison replies. “Because I didn’t feel like a victim. It goes a lot, lot, lot deeper than anybody realizes.”

	That’s what she and Badolato both understand. That’s why they started talking eight months ago. Of all the teenage victims Badolato’s task force recovered, Ellison is one of the few who she knows has permanently extricated herself from being prostituted, though it took years for her to get to that point, years for her to see that what happened to her was not her fault but rather a fault in the system, a fault in many systems over the course of generations. Neither she nor Badolato can fix that. 

	Yet they can’t help feeling like there’s something they can fix — or at least try to. Under the umbrella of an organization she’s founded called Innocent Warriors, Badolato created a program for schools, instructing educators on the signs that might indicate a student is being trafficked and teaching kids how to avoid getting groomed online, which, she believes, is not about stranger danger but rather an awareness of subtle manipulation. Ellison has been working with trafficked youth through nonprofits like Children of the Night, the residential program where Badolato’s team sent her when she was 17. Together, they’ve been talking about having Ellison help train undercovers who are learning to do trafficking sting ops. They’ve also discussed starting a mentorship program in which children who are still being sex-trafficked are paired with young adults like Ellison who once were, providing a way for victims to begin to envision a different future for themselves and a path toward it even while being prostituted. Such a program may be retroactive rather than proactive, but it would capitalize on Badolato’s and Ellison’s experience and expertise — and it could help in the healing of mentors and mentees alike.

	Badolato had traveled to Portland for the two to talk face-to-face about how the program might work. “You have to understand how they’ve been traumatized because sometimes, to a child, relating doesn’t sound like you’re relating. It sounds like you’re pointing out all the bad things in them,” says Ellison from the driver’s seat of her Nissan Pathfinder as she drives Badolato around to show her certain landmarks of her past after she’d left Children of the Night: the bridge she’d slept under for over a year after a boyfriend had gotten her hooked on heroin, the blocks downtown where she’d bounced between a children’s shelter and the needle exchange. It had taken a prison sentence for her to finally break her addiction and commit to a different kind of life, though that evolution had had less to do with not having access to drugs than with seeing her own mother cycle in and out of the same facility — like looking into her own future and witnessing how bleak it would be. Maybe, she thought, she could provide the inverse of that for kids in Innocent Warriors. Maybe she could reverse engineer her own escape.

	“I just want to make it very clear that if you were a victim, you are a victim, and just to not have any shame in that,” she tells Badolato as they drive through Portland’s misty streets. 

	“What I anticipate and hope is that then we get survivors that are like, ‘They get it,’ ” Badolato replies. “And that it opens up doors to help, for people to recognize that there are people who get what’s really going on.”



	“It took a really long time for me,” Ellison says of coming to terms with her own victimhood. 

	“It’s like reworking your thought process about some of those things,” Badolato agrees. “And that’s hard, and it happens slowly over time, and it looks different for everybody.”

	Ellison grips the wheel tightly. “The truth does matter. It does. The truth is the fucking truth. And it’s been empowering to be able to talk about it because that’s another way that I’ve realized, like, ‘Man, I was a victim,’ is re-going over all of this. Because when it happens so many times, you do blame yourself. It’s a lot easier to just continue to live in a lie than believe that you were lied to.”

	Still, Ellison and Badolato agree that the impressionability that makes children vulnerable is also what makes them open to guidance and mentorship if a relationship of trust can be established. “What do you think a parent does? They groom you. I’d been waiting to be guided and groomed,” Ellison says.

	It’s been instructive to see that potential from another perspective, as a mother doing the guiding. As the afternoon wears on, Ellison stops to pick up her then-15-month-old son, who was being watched by a social-worker friend. She buckles the little boy into his car seat, ruffles his hair, and passes him a bottle. He grins widely and begins removing his shoes and socks, throwing them gleefully onto the floor of the car and then kicking his tiny feet in time with the music as Ellison glances back at him and smiles. “Kids are so perfect,” she says.

	The last stop of the day is the large plot of land where the drug dealer’s house once stood. Now, it’s been turned into a playground, with brightly-colored jungle gyms, a covered picnic area, and a large lawn, where a couple leisurely walks their dog. Ellison and Badolato climb down from the car and stand at the park’s edge, as Ellison’s son toddles around the grass, oblivious to what had transpired in that very spot. There is some form of poetic justice in the land being earmarked for children’s enjoyment, but neither woman voices it. Mostly, they’re quiet. Night is falling, the air growing cooler, and the gray sky fading into dusk.

	“You would never think a park could hide what it used to be,” Ellison says at last. And yet it did. Driving off with Badolato at her side and her son babbling happily in the back seat, Ellison glances in the rearview mirror, but only for a moment. Badolato keeps her eyes fixed only on the road ahead.

  Cock.li is your go-to solution for professional E-mail and XMPP addresses. Since 2013 cock.li has provided stable E-mail services to an ever-increasing number of users. Cock.li allows registration and usage using Tor and other privacy services (proxies, VPNs) and thanks to continued funding by its users is certain to stay free forever.
  

      Some cock.li users elect to fund the site using cryptocurrency, and their donations go directly to the operating expenses of the site. Donations are calculated such that any surplus or deficit is carried to the next year, and are verifiable on the "block chain". If you'd like to support cock.li or view our financial reports, visit the Donate page.
      

        Cock.li discloses every enforceable legal order for user information on the transparency page, in direct publish or quarterly report format. Since 2017 there have been just two legal orders, both of which were heckin' cute and valid. For more information on how legal orders are handled, check the abuse page.
      

        You can't. Cock.li doesn't parse your E-mail to provide you with targeted ads, nor does cock.li read E-mail contents unless it's for a legal court order. However, it is 100% possible for me to read E-mail, and IMAP/SMTP doesn't provide user-side/client-side encryption, so you're just going to have to take my word for it. Any encryption implementation would still technically allow me to read E-mail, too. This was true for Lavabit as well -- while your E-mail was stored encrypted (only if you were a paid member, which most people forget), E-mail could still technically be intercepted while being received / sent (SMTP), or while being read by your mail client (IMAP). For privacy, we recommend encrypting your E-mails using PGP using a mail client add-on like Enigmail, or downloading your mail locally with POP and regularly deleting your mail from our server.
      
 Also, there's this quote from /g/:

        Administering a mail host is sort of like being a nurse; there's a brief period at the start when the thought of seeing people's privates might be vaguely titillating in a theoretical sense, but that sort of thing doesn't last long when it's up against the daily reality of shit, piss, blood, and vomit.
      

        Now that I think about it, administering a mail host is exactly like being a nurse, only people die slightly less often.
      

rvm

            RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby
            environments from interpreters to sets of gems.
          

          RVM is maintained and supported by the community via issue trackers and pull requests:
          


                on each project in RVM Github organization,
              


              especially
              
                RVM project issues tracker.
              




          RVM  lets you deploy each project with its own completely self-contained and dedicated environment,
          from the specific version of ruby, all the way down to the precise set of required gems to run your
          application. Having a precise set of gems also avoids the issue of version conflicts between
          projects, which can cause difficult-to-trace errors and hours of hair loss. With RVM, NO OTHER
          GEMS than those required are installed. This makes working with multiple complex applications, where
          each has a long list of gem dependencies, much more efficient. RVM lets you easily test gem upgrades,
          by switching to a new clean set of gems to test with, while leaving your original set intact.
          It is flexible enough to even let you maintain a set of gems per environment, or per development
          branch, or even per individual developer's taste!
        

          RVM reduces the complexity of the many facets of ruby development through
          its command-line API.  With RVM, you can have **identical** self-contained
          environments in your Development, CI, Q/A, Staging, and Production environments.
          No more hidden gotchas: if it works for one of them, it will work in all of them.
          With named gemsets, you can reliably and immediately push changes from one environment to another.
          And, RVM is for Ruby applications, *not just for Rails*!
          Any
          Ruby based application will benefit from your use of RVM.
        

          RVM enables you to easily test both upgrade and escape paths very easily and consistently.
          With RVM, you can run a test suite, rake tasks, benchmarks and gem commands against multiple ruby
          versions
          at the same time.
          This means that you can easily ensure your applications work in Ruby 1.8.X, REE, MRI 1.9.1, jruby,
          etc... and quickly expose any areas in which they do not.
        

          RVM has an extremely flexible gem management system called Named Gem Sets. RVM's 'gemsets' make
          managing gems across multiple versions of Ruby a non-issue. RVM lets you add a small text file to
          your application's repository, instead of checking in tons of gems which would needlessly inflate
          your repository size. Additionally, RVM's gemset management uses a common cache directory, so only
          one downloaded version of each gem resides on disk rather than several copies.
        

          RVM helps ensure that all aspects of Ruby are completely contained within user space, strongly
          encouraging safer, non-root use. Use of RVM rubies thus provides a higher level of system security,
          and therefore reduces risk and cuts overall system downtime. Additionally, since all processes run at
          the user level, a compromised ruby process cannot compromise the entire system.
        

          RVM is continuously evolving, thanks to community pull requests to the project.

Since I did a blog about WebP minus well do one about WebM. As some of you may know that I run a hybrid video/regular blog we use WebM because it's the latest and greatest. Back when I was running with the Angular theme that included its own version of MediaPlayer.js and all was good because the WebM files were being referenced first and foremost. That changed when I reverted back to a more standard WordPress theme that relied on the out-of-the-box MediaPlayer.js which is totally fine except for one problem.
Default WordPress HTML5 video player grabs MP4's first. Not WebM.

Now you may be thinking
What's the big deal S? A file is a file! and MP4 plays on everything.
Just because MP4 plays on everything doesn't mean that we have to endure the heavy bandwidth that video standard eats up.
In case you have no-script enabled or for some reason cannot see the title video on this website. I have provided direct links for these videos.
This is a video from one of my most recent blogs dealing with keyboard testing. it's a modest 480p file that lasts about 20 seconds. The file size of these videos are as follows:
These values can multiply exponentially when switching to higher frame rates and 1080p. But you get the idea. WebM provides roughly the same quality as the other two web-streaming formats but holding the lowest file size.
The reason why WordPress first foremost and always reaches for the MP4 file is due to an ancient standard with Apple. If you didn't have MP4 as the first video prefix within HTML5. The I-Pad simply gives up. It does not ask the website for any more sources. This is rather odd for apple to do considering they were the ones pushing for html5 and wanted to bury adobe flash once and for all. I guess Steve Jobs didn't catch every screw up in IOS! Also noted that this happened to really old versions of the I-Pad and any capable I-Pad that can be upgraded to IOS 10 and above stands a good chance at being perfectly fine now. There are currently no signs from WordPress to change the way media.php operates.
The first rule of WordPress hacking is you do NOT hack core!
There's a general rule that you're not supposed to break with WordPress. That rule is "Don't hack the core!" WordPress developers get super pissed off when people doing this because every-time a WordPress update comes out whatever mods get removed. Along with a ton of other security problems. You should create a child theme if you are to do any WordPress modifications. Go into your /WP-Includes folder within WordPress and modify your media.php file. At around line 2367 you will find the following statement that initializes the arrays
Flip around the webm format so it's in the front of the array like so.
Save the media.php script and the results will be immediate the moment you edit a video upload within WordPress
Instead of endangering your WordPress by screwing with the core. How about we create that child theme we talked about earlier? Creating a child theme is fairly simple by just making a directory and two or three text files. If you want to get really-fancy-pants about it you can even assign a screenshot.jpg into your child folder. But for this article we're going to manipulate the functions.php file within our child theme.
This is a little more complicated because we're moving around strings within the wp_video_extensions to bring WebM up to the first thing WordPress will try. But this technique is crazy safe because even if WordPress changes the media.php to accept more codecs then the worse that will happen is you may need to play with str_replace a little bit. Instead of receiving the white screen of death.
Update: 10/22/2017
This is my new code. A lot more aggressive as it defines a new array to replace WordPress Cores original. you could even remove formats that you don't use which I have done by simply having ('webm', 'mp4', 'ogv') and that's it. No need for the extra garbage formats to exist.
If you think you have to hack core, you are thinking about the problem incorrectly.
Savage bro! I don't know really. Writing lines of PHP code with minimal documentation or changing a variable in a constantly changing core just seems like the thinking is broken either way you look at it really! But out of interest of sanity and upgrades messing with the core is never a good idea and they are correct on this.
We had to ask WordPress ourselves about this which they gave us a ton of links to how hooks and filters operate within WordPress. So thanks to the forum devs and moderators for helping us out! Â  Â   Â  Now WebM is first in the list and not second anymore all of your sites with video will attempt to load WebM first before jumping to anything else. Also, when you play videos on a browser such as Chrome, something specifically designed for WebM material it will grab that video file first. Safari and IE will then fall backwards to MP4 with the last resort on the very bottom with OGV.
Also it's a really good idea to add the new file types within your Apache .htaccess folder as Firefox tends to look at MIME types more closely the other browsers. And if you don't have a defined type there's a good chance FireFox will not play it.
There are people who state that switching from the age-old standard of MP4 to a format which is only backed by Google is stupid. Or that crippled 2nd and 3rd generation I-Pads won't be able to view your video (they totally can, they just have to click on the MP4 links we've given out). Then there's people like us who do not give a shit about maintaining the status quota on our website to appease old/dying apple standards. And instead would rather distribute the best format image to the best browsers of today at lower bandwidths then ever before!
You're just a Google fanboy/suck up aren't you?
Not overly. I think their technology is interesting but I despise their social policies as we will point you to on the YouTube blog. Currently WebP and WebM are offering the most advanced way to send compressed images to a browser. But the truth is if another company comes along offering something better I will most definitely look into it. But for now the latest formats deserve to be in the front of the line on a media player with the old standards behind to make browsers behind the curve happy.

Bisq is a decentralized bitcoin exchange network that enables secure, private and censorship-resistant exchange of bitcoin for national currencies and other cryptocurrencies over the internet.

The Bisq application forms a peer-to-peer network by discovering, connecting to, and working with one another to implement the Bisq trading protocol. The Bisq network is fully peer-to-peer in that it requires no centrally-controlled servers and has no single points of failure.

See more details in the introduction.

Bisq is built on pure P2P infrastructure: desktop software, Tor, local wallets, and no central accounts. Furthermore, it is not a company, and its governance model actually incentivizes the protection of user privacy and freedoms.

While the transfer of national currency requires traditional payment channels like banks and payment processors, Bisq is not dependent on any particular provider. The role of these payment channels is limited to what it should be: transferring national currency. That's itâno censoring, confiscating, monitoring, or controlling your financial transactions.

Bisq is built for those who:

WLAN gained support for EAP-PEAP, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS authentication methods.
Sailfish OS is compatible with the Androidâ¢ ecosystem, and so able to run Android apps and support Android device hardware. However, itâs fully independent, and not a derivative or a fork of the Android codebase.
Sailfish licensees choose if they wish to use the Android compatibility part in the OS, or instead opt for fully native solutions.
 App support is also offered for other Linux-based systems through AppSupport for Linux Platforms product.
Android App Support in Sailfish 4 has reached Android 11 level. Android apps now support richer notifications, handle audio and video calls better, has enhanced security and can access content from SD cards and detect WLAN connections.
Sailfish 4 ensures that your device is protected on multiple fronts: user data is encrypted on the device, network communication is secured using VPN, and the in-built firewall and sandboxing further safeguards your data and device resources from abuse. Over-the-air updates and hotfix releases allow us to address any critical vulnerabilities quickly and promptly.
Sandboxing limits an applicationâs access to only the minimum needed user data and system functions to contain the damage if an app becomes compromised.

 
Core OS services that control critical hardware functionality have been limited to having access only to the capabilities each domain requires, enforced by using systemd sandboxing.
Sailfish OS has built-in support for common VPNs and a new plug-in API for integrating 3rd party providers. VPN support is powered by improved auto-connection support and route management.
Encryption is enabled on all new Sailfish devices. This helps to keep data safe whether it is stored on the device, on a memory card, or a USB On-The-Go storage.
We don’t collect or sell personal data. Connect devices to the services you trust or set up your own cloud. We donât take any share of digital sales happening on Sailfish OS devices.
Sailfish OS is an open platform based on Linux and over 500 open source projects. Licensees get full source code access to the OS, tooling, and infrastructure.
Work comfortably knowing your data is automatically backed-up to the cloud. Choose a service you trust or set up your own backup servers.
Sailfish 4 has greatly improved developer offering with faster cross-platform builds using Docker, a new powerful command-line interface, improved coding assistance with Clang Code Model, 64-bit builds, C++14, Rust, CMake, and lots more! Also remember to check out the new Sailfish OS developer forum.
Sailfish 4 answers to the feedback from our customers and technical community: we are opening access to critical platform capabilities. Here are some of the highlights from our roadmap:
Enable photo capture and video recording using the simplified Camera API with preset defaults, better focus and front camera handling.
Easily migrate your tab-based app from other mobile operating systems to Sailfish OS.
Publish different kinds of notifications for your app: display progress, embed different actions, show avatars or other graphics, play tones, customize text layouts, and so on.
Read more âº
Define powerful forms and improve other text editing flows with embedded actions, icons and other indications, user hints, custom backgrounds, validation, and so on.
Read more âº
Let users control media playback of your app from wired and Bluetooth headsets, in-built hardware keys, and from audio controls on the Lock Screen.
Sailfish OS comes armed with a state-of-the-art open source toolchain, release machinery, continuous integration (CI) and build systems, as well as issue tracking and localization tools. Let the global Jolla infrastructure support your business, take the reference infrastructure into use regionally or integrate to your existing infrastructure.
Sailfish 4 introduces redesigned usage flows for all daily use cases, and a new, crisp visual style improving the legibility across the platform. New ambiences, a significant browser upgrade, and a new battery saving mode to squeeze more usage time out of every device are also part of the Sailfish 4 experience.
You can now access your notifications, calendar events, and weather information without unlocking your device.
The entire Events view has gone through a redesign with much improved notifications, better grouping in the calendar widget, and the weather gaining hourly forecast support and new colorful icons.
Legibility has taken a big leap forward with small, but important tweaks to colors, dimming, fonts, background processing, and effects that result in better contrast.
Further, a special high contrast mode has been introduced for text-heavy use cases like writing emails or reading documents.
Four gorgeous new ambiences make your user experience feel brand new.
The Sailfish 4 browser is armed with a new browser engine (from Firefox Quantum), designed to take full advantage of the processing power of modern devices. More importantly, the focus of the renewed browser has been on security – introducing features such as site permissions, password manager, and certificate info.
Read more âº
Define access rules for your browser and individual sites. The renewed browser also has new bookmark and history views, and allows you to save websites as PDF.
Automatically opened captive portals are now run in a special restricted mode, blocked from accessing system cookies.
Access site security information easily from the address bar and review certificate issuers. Get notified when security vulnerabilities are discovered.
The Sailfish 4 email viewer has been upgraded to a new engine. This enables big improvements to the rendering and compatibility, and new features like copy and paste support.
You can easily set scheduled automatic replies for when you are not available.
You can now easily handle Active Sync meeting invitations in both Calendar and Email apps.
Sailfish 4 Calendar also supports subscribing to ICS web calendars. Email app comes with global address list (GAL) support. Attachment opening is 50-90% faster due to the dozens of optimizations made to the document viewer since Sailfish 3.
In Sailfish 4 the gesture indications to answer and reject calls are right under your thumb. Answer by swiping horizontally in either direction without having to worry about whether you picked up the device in the right orientation. Silence by swiping up or by pressing the power key.
Sometimes writing a reply is a hassle. Send a quick reply and go about your business. You can easily add and manage quick replies in Phone settings.
If you are too busy to answer, add a reminder for you to call the person back. You can also easily add and manage reminders in the Phone app.
The full-screen call ending dialog has been replaced with a smaller popup. If the call was ended by you, no dialog is shown, freeing you up to jump to the next task.
Access contacts the way you want: pin as favourites, access from recents, search device contacts or contacts in the cloud, jump to the right contact using the alphabet scrollbar, or just flick to browse all.
Quickly glance important information on the card and perform actions without the need to manually expand groups like before.
The contact form in Sailfish 4 has been redesigned to make it faster to type the most common details.
Auto completion support now learns from previous inputs, you donât have to type anything twice.
Explicitly choose where to store new contacts to avoid leaking data. Easily manage both your personal and company contacts within the same device.
Thanks to our community, our language and local support is growing all the time. Vietnamese, Lithuanian, Slovak and Romanian are the latest languages to join the party.
Read more âº
Text input support comes with all the bells and whistles you would expect: XT9â¢ text prediction and error correction, dead key support for inputing diacritics, split keyboard for thumb-friendly landscape typing. Chinese keyboards support pinyin, stroke, and handwriting inputs.
In Sailfish 4 you can now select multiple key layouts for your peripherial Bluetooth or USB-OTG keyboards, and switch between input languages using the Ctrl+Space shortcut.
Easily record and playback audio clips. Manage recordings and easily share over different connectivity and messaging options or upload to one of your online accounts.
Messages has been supercharged with better grouping and simplified style. A contact header has been added to make it easier to see who you are talking to. Also the send button is now more prominent.
Enable battery saving mode to squeeze more usage time out of your device, and even set automatic thresholds based on your preferences.
Open links to websites and apps with the Camera app without having to manually type the URLs, or set up a WLAN hotspot using a QR code.

I guess this is the season for sensationalist hype of computer crime:  first CNN, and then USA Today (drug users and Internet crime, for a double-scary story).
Beware the Four Horsemen of the Information Apocalypse: terrorists, drug dealers, kidnappers, and child pornographers.  Seems like you can scare any public into allowing the government to do anything with those four.

In Europe, the Four Horsemen are terrorists, organized crime, pedophiles and neo-nazis. Works very well, too. In fact, works good enough to scare the European Parliament into accepting a bill that mandates a gigantic surveillance infrastructure. I suppose the public is either scared as well or, as usually, not interested in anything except the latest celebrity “news”. Maybe it’s just me, but I didn’t see more than a sidenote in any national news outlet (if it’s mentioned at all), and much less any kind of public outrage. Pretty disturbing.

Sure, fear sells! What is the best way to turn off any critical thinking than scaring people? You just need a few seemingly plausible threats.
Companies seem to be catching on … How about this thinggy called “OnStar”? If you listen to their commercials, it sounds like  you are invariably going to DIE in your car unless you get “OnStar”.
Which coincidently can spy on you, by listening to the conversations by the means of the installed microphone. But, surely, “The Big Brother” always has YOUR best interests in his mind!

OnStar has always scared me. I have always figured that whoever figures out how to hack OnStar will have a great time tracking people, stealing cars, etc.
I don’t mind having a GPS receiver in my car, or a physical switch-on transceiver, but having something that automagically goes on worries me a lot, especially when it’s tied into the locks on the car.

onstar is a way creepy thing, i’ve seen the commercials, you get in some kind of trouble or lock yourself out of your car and this omniscient benevolent babysitter comes to your rescue.
if you need a babysitter while you’re driving, you shouldn’t be driving at all.
onstar is just the tip of the iceberg.  there are also onboard diagnostic devices hooked up to the airbags in most new cars which record speed, braking, etc. and are available for later inspection by anybody who can get a court order.
the state of oregon formed a special commission to study a new tax on miles driven in oregon by oregonians.  it would require a gps in every oregon-registered vehicle and the commission explained that this would inform the state when we’d left its borders so that we would no longer be taxed for those miles.  yes, hacking this would be child’s play.  yes, i like to be all alone sometimes with nobody knowing where i am and i’m willing to execute drastic measures to achieve this, but worst of all…..
the tourists from california, they would be able to drive on the same roads i do and not be taxed!  the oregon public services infrastructure is on life support in many areas, no sales tax, laughable property tax, only a vicious 9% income tax.  my answer is to soak the tourists, not exempt them.

He did get a insurance break because of it but if he is ever in a accedent he is worried that they may pull other driving info from his past like how fast he drives on a certian road ect. Does anyone have any answers to this. It seems like it is a voilation of your rights?

Privacy? Security?
His eyes were dark grey as he scanned the late afternoon sunlight.
As if you could find it now..
he leaned back, and said ” Listen. You bought the sneakers with the RFID that Wal-Mart
specified to be implanted in the soles for stocking and store security purposes, and then
you paid with a Visa card. The chip in your purchase will respond to a backscatter sensor
from over 30 feet away with a 54 digit Identifier. Therefore your shoes would give a good
investigator your Identification through your local wal-Mart’s computer records with a single query.
The number won’t change, and will respond to any compatible RFID sensor you come close to.
Therefore, if you are looking for that “privacy and security”, I suggest that you actually
microwave your sneakers for at least three seconds on high, and you better throw your
Target brand sweater in after that.- and check your wallet too. ”
I was aghast. He continued,
“Where ever you’ve gone today; you’re leaving a record you can’t see.”

Sorry if this is just too newb, but can you tell me how to get my ISP from invading my privacy? My address menu always displays something from them called Security Check, and it lists a secure URL for them. This happens whether I’m using Vista Firefox or Ubuntu Firefox. Can I block them from my system or will that prevent me from getting online? Does Tor provide security from them?
I also have questions about the ability of my employer (a hospital) to monitor my email, even though I never access it from work, nor do they pay for my account. They do, however, have a business agreement with the telecommunications company that also happens to be my ISP. I have remained steadfast in my refusing to accept a discounted phone bill through my employer’s connection, because I assume that will legitimize their scrutiny.

Governments have had a symbiotic relationship with Telcos since the 1940’s
As well as media services and all licensed broadcasters. (Hence licensing Laws)
The licensing agreements provide the government and its agencies to obtain any information they choose about anyone who uses their service. Under the pretense of privacy for the client. That is lie #55.
The best privacy is not letting the government or its agencies know your business. Period.

@ hiding under the couch,
“Can this be fixed? I just want peace.”
Do you want the short answer or the long answer?
The short answer :- is after you type any of your details into an internet connected machine you might as well assume you have broadcast them to the world forever, so no there is nothing you can do about what you have already typed.
The Long answer :- Is to disasociate the various parts of your life from each other and treat them in the same way you do “old school friends”, “past friends”, “ex girlfriends”, “current work colleagues”, “past work colleagues”, “past church life”, “current church life”, etc etc.
That is treat the various non-core parts of your life as seperate roles, that each has an independent identity from each other that is fully disposable at a moments notice.
Outside of your “core life” each role has it’s own nickname email address, VoIP & mobile number, disposable pre-charge payment card and even postal address as required.
For your core life (tax banking etc) do not use the Internet or anything other than good old fashioned “snail mail”. Effectivly use two seperate PC’s one for offline “core life” activities the other for “role based personas”.
Be paranoid and assume they are out to get you as they genuinaly are. The more details an entity can build up about you the more valuable the information becomes not just to identity fraudsters but marketers and others you have had good reason to break ties with.
Never ever use your “core-life” real address telephone number etc on line ever. Organisations you have supplied those details to never do business with online.
Monetary transactions should be by cash, that is don’t transfere money from your core-life bank account to pay bills or pre-charge a payment card. Never use a role based persona across roles, that is if you are fred123 don’t use the VoIP number for jim234. Likewise don’t use mobile phones (even with different SIMs) for different roles. Old mobile phones can be bought for next to nothing. Never ever down grade your core or role phones down to another role. When you want to get a new mobile clean up the old one take out the SIM and any Memory card and flog it via the offline second hand market. Always buy role based phones on that personas pre pay card.
All this is because at some point the data sets will cross over and it will be corelated (you cannot anonymise data with any level of utility sufficiently to prevent re-identification).
Oh and to clear up your current state, it’s time to move your core life away from where you live (if you can) and offline permanently.
Two PC’s sounds expensive but actually it’s not. You have one good quality machine for your core life and another older machine with no hard disk plenty of RAM and a memory stick for each persona. Run the system of a CD-ROM (not re-writable) based OS. If you cannot hack Unix then look at how to put MS onto CD-ROM there are toolkits out there, but I’d advise against it MS puts lots of machine based metadata into OS and user files including network card MAC addressess and CPU ID tags etc etc.
Have a hunt around on the Internet (from a cafe etc) for various advice documents for NGO’s working in hostile countries they go into various uses of anonymous services like TOR and re-mailers etc. DON’T put the document onto your hard drive, print it out and then securly delet it from a USB memory stick.
If you think this sounds paranoid a few years ago it would have been, these days it’s being moderatly cautious, in a couple of years time you and many others will wish you had and a few after that it will be normal behaviour for most sensible people.

If you’re going to run a HD-less computer, and use OS’s to run from CD-ROM:  I just tried Slax Linux out.  It has a really small footprint, only needs a small amount of RAM and you can build a custom one (add modules) on their website.  But their Firefox can’t run Youtube videos unless you tell it to disallow a certain ad script that runs on Youtube.

It is kind of you to say so, sadly though the reality is more a “prophet of doom”, due to the all to predictable nature of those given both power and wealth, who also chose not to acknowledge the harm they do. Harm not just to society but also as a consequence of their actions to themselves and their loved ones (assuming they have any).

Seems to me that frightening criminals from engaging in their activities online is counterproductive for law enforcement in that the perps will be forced to develop ever-subtler and more secure means of communication to evade the snoops, leaving the rest of us vulnerable to all sorts of snooping we are prohibited from knowing about.  Take Al Qaeda for example.  They shifted to communicating via live carriers when they realized their cell phones were being monitored.

@ Mark Harder,
Seems to me that frightening criminals from engaging in their activities online is counterproductive for law enforcement in that the perps…
It depends on the viewpoint, contrary to what most people think, LEAs are not paid to just catch criminals. In todays “cost efficient policing” it’s all about numbers which in the main means “get the low hanging fruit” as this provides best numbers for seniors to wave around at politicos etc.
There are exceptions which are crimes that are newsworthy for some reason. When one of these types of crime happens LEA seniors apply resorces disproportionate to the norm in order to control public opinion as dictated by politicos and journalists.
Thus as you would expect the types of criminal that will be targeted under normal circumstances will be those that are not particularly clever/knowledgeable or just don’t care if they are caught for whatever reason.
But there is a secondary effect which is for the LEAs and others to talk up crimes and make them appear to be much worse than they realy are.
There are several reasons for this and it’s all to do with the “numbers”.
As has been said often there is a calculation performed as to the value of the crime compared to the resources applied. Put simply there is a bar or hurdle, if the value of the crime is below the bar then the crime gets minimal resources, if it’s above the first bar then it clears that hurdle and gets an increased level of resources. So onwards up the scale of bars/hurdles.
If an investigating officer can show quickly that a new crime is in someway linked to other similar crimes then the aggregated value is used to decide if more resources are required.
So the individual LEOs have an incentive to link crimes together to get the resources to ensure some crimes actually get investigated.
It also means that it changes their own individual targets so that catching one individual who has committed lots of litttle crimes is worth a lot more than catching criminals that do infrequent crimes.
A side effect of this is to “load up” a criminal. That is if a criminal is caught for one crime, their value is small to an officers individual targets. However connect the criminal with a lot of crimes and suddenly they become quite valuable to the individual officers, as the officers individual targets are related to crimes committed not criminals convicted. But there is a quirk in the system in that criminals get to do prison sentances concurrantly not consecutively. Thus the time served is realy only related to the most serious crime. So deppending on the jurisdiction the officer has either the discretion to talk to the judge to get the sentance for that crime reduced or the officer can use a plea barganing route to reduce the severity of the crime. Thus perversly it’s sometimes to a criminals advantage to plead guilty to lots of minnor crimes they have not committed as it reduces their actuall time served for a more serious crime they have committed…
It’s win-win for the officer and criminal, it’s also win-win for the LEA and politicos because it makes the clear up rate look good. But society loses because the real criminal for those crimes goes unpunished.
Whilst you can argue away “loading up” as a necessary evil of LEAs having to do impossible “efficiency” increases it however turns the LEAs into criminals themselves (knowingly presennting false information to a court is perjury).
Once they have crossed that line the next line is easier to cross which is “fitting up”. This is where the LEA has a newsworthy or politicaly sensitive crime to deal with where results are required. What the LEOs on the case do is arrrest an individual who looks most likely then build a case to make them guilty. That is the LEOs only look for information to associate the arrested person to the crime, not for evidence that dissociates the arrested person with the crime. Whilst this might start as a “group think” issue for a small team that is under preasure, it can quickly get worse with the witholding of evidence from the defence or worse still from destroying evidence that would clear the person to the very deliberate fraud of fabrication of evidence against the person to ensure conviction.
But of more recent times there is a new game in town of inventing crimes and arresting suspects prior to the supposed crime and prosecuting them for “conspiracy to comit…” or similar. We have seen this with Terrorist cases and it will spread out to other areas with time. In essence it’s a ‘he says she says’ argument that gave rise to the notion of “thought crime”.
But “thought crime” has actually been around with us for hundreds if not thousands of years one way or another. Most notably with the sayings attributed to Cardinal Richelieu,
If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something within them to have him hanged.
However another saying attributed to the Cardinal,
Harshness towards individuals who flout the laws and commands of state is for the public good; no greater crime against the public interest is possible than to show leniency to those who violate it.
Can be seen as the basis not just for excusing all the above behaviours but in actually fostering new crimes.
What we are seeing is new laws being put on the statute books that are now so broad in definition that it is difficult to see how a normal person can defend themselves against being found guilty.
So now all an LEA has to do to meet it’s numbers is randomly select people to be classified as criminals and then have them convicted.
Which brings me back to your point,
… in that the perps will be forced to develop ever-subtler and more secure means of communication to evade the snoops, leaving the rest of us vulnerable to all sorts of snooping we are prohibited from knowing about.
In the UK this has certainly been the case. People have been accused of being terrorists but have not been allowed to see the evidence against them as it would reveal “methods and sources” of the security forces. Because some judges have told the prosecution “put up or shut up” some alledged terrorists have been put in a kind of limbo wheere they have been arressted charged and detained but have not been brought to trial or deported from the country. A case brought to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) declared this policy to be illegal thus the alledged terrorists were released under what is in effect “house arrest”. No doubt there will be further submissions to the ECHR over time, but the UK government appears determined to continue the cat and mouse game, if for no other reason that of Political Face Saving.

Loved your comments, Clive, on the current state of criminalizing by LEO’s.  Everything is about numbers from every system I can possibly call to mind.
I used to naively believe in upward mobility and was taught to believe in free enterprise as a product created by hard work and due diligence but I have lost all faith in the values that were ingrained in me as a child.  While a few do deserve all they have attained because they are truly brilliant and deserving of their prosperity, overall that isn’t what I see in the world we live in.  In general and as a rule, success has little to do with stong work ethics; things such as hard work and dedication.
All ideals I lived by were wrong.  I became really disallusioned when I began to witness the corrupt nature of things.  I believed that the result of my hard work, dedication, loyalty, efficiency and other admirable (or so I though) traits or efforts would automatically equate to the natural order of advancement, recognition and subsequent monetary compensation.  My beliefs were what I now know to equal plain and simple denial of the reality of every aspect of our society.
Everything is about money, at any cost, with no regard for law, waste, overhead, ineffeciency, and the mediocre masses that sit at desks and in cubicle hives.
When I finally was able to see, the truth made me sick by simply bearing witness to the injustices that are written off as simply the way of the world or so it seems.  The core or basis of our society is rigged and diseased. By simply paying attention, the corruption can be seen in every aspect of industry from big business such as pharmaceutical, insurance, oil and gas to local, state and US government… public service, media, politics, education and so on.
When I began to see the way things really work, how the rich do get richer generally through nepotism or sheer privilege and how business is really contingent on under the table payoffs, misappropriation and just riddled with crime, I lost faith.  While I’m grateful to live in a democratic country, I’m not so sure it’s truly the land of the free and home of the brave. Not that any other country isn’t a thousand times more corrupt making me think it’s not just us, perhaps it’s simply part of human nature or the human condition.  One could say it’s even religious, the sins of man as forgiven by simply asking for forgiveness if you believe we are the progeny of Adam and Eve, the children of the Son.
The biggest crimes in society aside from say serial killers or terrorist attacks perhaps, seem to be committed by those in the highest esteem and positions in society. Outwardly they garner our respect but if the truth be known by all of how corrupt our society truly is, I’d hope citizens would unite and as a whole would strait the gate, true the wheel and set right what is so wrong with our world today.
I really enjoyed reading this blog but especially what you wrote, Clive, in response to Mark Harder.  Excellent writing and beautiful style to boot.

@ WebheadedStepChild,
Thank you for your kind words.
However having just re-read my two main posts on this page, I’m left with the hindsight feeling I was perhaps to optomistic compared to what we now know was going on at the time due to the Ed Snowden revelations. It saddens me to see the world this way, because as history teaches us repression is followed by revolution almost as assuredly as night follows day, and when those dark times do come, they will most likely involve violence as the old gaurd fight to maintain their position. I find myself asking “what legacy have we left for our descendants” and the answering thoughts are not what I and I suspect many others would want.
What scares me is thoughts of the Roman Empire, how it used “bread and circuses” to keep the population compliant, and when it supposedly “fell to barbarians at the gate” it was the civilian population that paid the price, those still with sanity and power quietly metamorphosed into what became “The Holy Roman Empire” which is still with us today with more power and wealth than the original Roman despots could have ever dreamed of. I find myself asking “is this the model our hidden states are working to” with the positions of clowns and fools taken by our politicians…

If ON STAR is a problem for you, try disableing the antenna with a switch for, preventing incoming and out going signal, at your discretion. From what I understand about it having a “relative” short term memory for crash data and such. I noticed that in some circumstances the signal is lost from satelite. You will know you are sucessful if you quit getting your service updates.

Thank you. My very 1st time using the tor browser this was the second web page I saw. Incredible how many like minded individuals who are able to see what’s really happening. Weather? Laws? Money? Food? Corporations? summed up as “way of living”.
  I too believe that change will only be brought about when the people HAVE actually had enough and rise up against the tyranny set out to control us. Like aaaalllllll the societies before us in one degree or another and as far as we know.
 A U.S. revolution at this in this day and age? With their technology? Stuff a lot of us normal regular “citizens” never even heard of let alone have seen.It would have to be an extremely clever covert grassroots underground network of a boatload of like minded intelligent clever individuals who have absolutely no agendas of there own except the unified idea of all our individual freedoms are also free to us all.

Clive Robinson – visionary, indeed!
I’m a new Tor user.
Yes, we continue to follow patterns, long-established, historically… Economic downturn is invariably followed by a dramatic political move to the right – where Hitler rode in to ‘rescue’ a drowning German nation, so May, Trump, Putin & Farage busk along, behind him. Doors open for extreme politicians and extremist behaviours, which previously wouldn’t have been entertained – Putin, Farage, Trump, May, Boris Johnson, all of Trump’s and May’s appointees, etc…
Theresa May has just succeeded in passing new laws, in the UK, which legalise the unencumbered, fully-comprehensive surveillance of every single UK citizen, without requiring any evidence, nor even suspicion, of having even considered committing a crime. Our emails, phone calls, browsing history, social media interactions, colour-choice of underwear etc…  So, here I am, well into my 50s, trying out Tor!
I don’t believe ‘revolution’ (as we used to understand the term) will resolve this hideous situation. Obvious ‘armies’ of people are rather easy to identify and ‘disarm’ (in the UK, certainly – where we don’t have the right to bear arms). I’m relieved that we don’t have the right to own guns and I believe that non-violent action is a really good way forward.
This thread is encouraging me to challenge my thinking about what I believe WOULD work, to derail the above-mentioned nut-jobs…
Talking of derail, the rail/tube strike activity in London, on Monday (yesterday), did a really good job of SERIOUSLY messing up the city’s activities. English folk have been brainwashed to loathe trade unions, but we might realise, in time to use it, the huge power of withdrawing our labour. We have an opportunity, right now, to rediscover that type of activism  –  which hits the power- and money-hungry despots right where it hurts. As production and services become fully robot-ised, the opportunity will be gone, but right now and for a while yet, it’s there  –  ‘all’ we need is for ‘ordinary people’ to realise that they currently have an extraordinary opportunity to REALLY ‘take back control’. It necessitates GETTING OFF OUR ARSES – and that’s the part I have some doubts about.
I’m still going to haul my arse out for our weekly protest, this Saturday  –  maybe the physical action of protest will ‘go viral’…
In the meantime, thank you, Tor.. and you, Clive Robinson.

@ Snapshooter2017,
Clive Robinson – visionary, indeed!
Sadly I was to optimistic in my view point, at the time.
As you are aware things have got worse considerably worse.
Whilst at one time Tor was sufficiently secure, we now know that it is deficient in a whole manner of ways. Pre Snowden trove documentation, upto around 2008 it was only the likes of the Five-Eyes that could make inroads on Tor.
Now as we know the likes of the FBI have paid very large sums of money to certain Universities. Where some of the brightest and best have utilised various deficiencies that I and others had been highlighting as needing fixing.
What was not clear then was why the Tor Foundation avoided fixing these deficiencies. There have been various reasons suggested by several people, but still the deficiencies are there a decade later, with apparently no effort made to fix them.
Thus if you look on other threds of this blog, I urge people to use Tor with some considerable caution and care.
My old point about moving security end points remains true. However the likes of Intel and AMD have in effect backdoored systems not just with their “Managment Engines” but also with built in radio networking etc.
Thus my advice has changed from “air gapped” to “energy gapped” and now I tell people to consider “Pencil and Paper” cryptography to “take the security end point off of all computers”.
I also offer other thoughts on how to avoid security “end runs” to protect from other sensors such as hidden CCTV in home appliances and likewise hidden microphones in these new Siri like sysyems that send all audio back across the Internet, in ways that we have no way of knowing are at all secure. Thus it’s wise to assume that the Signals Agencies can listen in…
Then there is what in effect is Doppler Radar using the likes of Wifi to image through walls, supposadly with sufficient resolution that hand movments can be worked out. Thus combined with other methods such as various types of microphone, what you write on a piece of paper might be worked out.
In the past I have described what you need to do to take apparently benign household objects to make your own temporary Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF, pronounced “skiff”). Such that it can be put together and taken down very quickly.
There is an obvious problem with this which is individuals are impatient, and SiG Int organisations very patient. Thus they will catch and use any mistake in OpSec you might make.
Whilst it is still possible for individuals to get privacy through security / OpSec it is getting more and more difficult. But whilst you may be secure at your end, it’s others that you have no control over who will do what they please and often without thought (think of all those “Driving Under the Influence” convictions to see why).

Me-just me â¢

					
						February 5, 2017 10:15 PM					

Mayhap the deficiencies of Tor are an example of the patience of SiG Int.
What better way to get into someone’s camp, than to provide them a tent to shelter themselves from your prying eyes?

I am wondering if those on this blog might want to affect something practical: So called “Smart Meters” are being used around the world to affect home privacy, home health, and freedom in general.
– 1. They are really computer networks, powered by harmful microwaves. I know people who “tingle” as they get near one, and others who get headaches when the sit near one (inside the house) for 15 minutes. These networks are powered by a similar type microwave pulses used in your microwave oven, sometimes hundreds or thousands of pulses per hour.
– 2. The power company executives expect to “harvest” your data and sell it, and that your data will be more profitable to the electric company than the electricity you buy. Various items in your home or business have power usage signatures, like refrigerators, hair dryers, computers, printers, etc. They will know when you turn on your lights, take a bath, cook, etc.
– 3. There is a new generation of micro wave network compatible appliances now on the market. They will be able to turn on and off your “smart” light bulbs, stove, hot water, and even control the heat in your home.
– 4. This data will be transmitted to every other node on the microwave network in your neighborhood. In other words, to everyone with electricity in your neighborhood.
– 5.These networks, like all computers can be hacked, so any clever kid in a basement, or even the NSA or CIA, will have access to this data and power over you. Any local cop who might not like you will be able to trump up charges based on “evidence” manipulated after taken from the network.
Finally, I hope you check out and share https://inpowermovement.com/

You can open Saver Plus account face-to-face in one of our Relationship CentresÂ or by downloading an application form and sending it to us with proof of identity.
Our Saver Plus account is ideal if you want to save money and only need to make a handful of withdrawals each year. Youâll get a better rate of interest than our Instant Access Saver and can make up to 4 withdrawals in a 12 month period.
If you think youâll make regular withdrawals from your savings then our Instant Access Saver account might be better suited to you.
4.81% Gross/AER variable.
AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest was paid and added each year.
Gross interest is paid annually into your account without tax deducted on 31 March each year. You might be required to pay tax on savings interest â this should be arranged directly with HMRC through your tax return.
The interest rate is variable and can change â if it increases, weâll update our website and, if the rate goes down, weâll write to you 14 days before it changes.
You can find out more about changes to our interest rates by reading our Savings Terms & Conditions.
After 12 months the estimated balance would be Â£1,048.10
This estimate is just for illustrative purposes and doesnât take into account any deposits or withdrawals you might make.
Accounts can be opened by anyone aged 18 or over. Applicants must be resident in the UK.
You can open a Saver Plus account in one of our Relationship Centres, or if itâs easier for you, you can download an application form and send it to us with a cheque for your initial deposit and proof of ID. Please read our Proof of ID checklist for details of ID we can accept.
The minimum opening deposit amount is Â£100, up to a maximum of Â£1,000,000.
Youâll get a passbook when you open the account and you can make deposits in our Relationship Centres (cash or cheque), by post (cheques only) or by bank transfer. For more information see managing your savings account.
You can make withdrawals in person in one of our Relationship Centres, or by post â whichever suits you best. Just keep in mind that this savings account offers you a better rate for not making regular withdrawals and is designed for those who are able to make 4 or fewer withdrawals per year.
If you make a 5th withdrawal in any rolling 12 month period, your account will convert to our Instant Access Saver (or an equivalent if that account is no longer available), and the relevant account terms and conditions and interest rates will apply.
You can make unlimited withdrawals in our Relationship Centres without notice, penalty or charges. Youâll need to bring proof of ID with you (for example, a valid Passport) and your signature (for example, a valid driving licence).
A maximum of Â£1,000 cash can be withdrawn from our Relationship Centres per day, and you need to keep the minimum balance of Â£100. This is not an account for making day-to-day payments.
You can also request withdrawals to your nominated account by post.
Gross interest is paid directly into your account without tax deducted each year on 31 March. You might need to pay tax on savings interest â this should be arranged directly with HMRC through your tax return.
If youâre a basic rate taxpayer and have savings income or interest of more than Â£1,000 (Â£500 for higher rate taxpayers), youâll have to pay some tax on this. You can find out more by calling HMRC on 0300 200 3300 or visit hmrc.gov.uk
Please read the Savings Terms & Conditions section for general conditions.
Â 
The deposits in your Instant Access Saver are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the UKâs deposit guarantee scheme.
If your bank or building society fails and canât pay back your money, FSCS can automatically pay you compensation:
up to Â£85,000 per eligible person, per bank, building society or credit union.
up to Â£170,000 for joint accounts.
Find out more by visiting fscs.org.uk
You can visit us in our Relationship Centres, or call us on 0333 207 4007. Our lines are open 9am - 5pm Monday to Friday (10am - 5pm Wednesday). Calls may be recorded and/or monitored.

screenshots
… to the screenshots.page!
Test a website's page using IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
Compare two screenshots of the same page.
Once retrieved via an IPv4 enabled machine and internet connection, the page's screenshot will appear here.
Once retrieved via an IPv6 enabled machine and internet connection, the page's screenshot will appear here. If no AAAA record is found, we'll let you know.
Few users on the internet have access to both IPv4 and IPv6 connections. Consequently they are unable to know for sure if a website is actually accessible over IPv6 connections.
Sure, there are services that 'check' if a connection or domain is IPv6 ready, but they usually lookup DNS NS, AAAA and CNAME records only, leaving out an important part of the puzzle: server configuration.
Screenshots.page retrieves the actual page and all its assets (images and basic scripts) and then creates a screenshot of it. If the two representations look similar, then you're in the clear. If they do not, you've got work to do .
The cause could be found by inspecting a number of factors:

Our clearnet relay servers do not, have not, and never will keep logs. Our outbound and inbound mail servers are set to be disposable and can be rapidly relocated. All queued data on them are immediately purged after being processed.

Note
SecureDrop wants your feedback! Confused by something in our
documentation? Let us know by opening an issue on GitHub or
engaging in our community forum.
SecureDrop servers are managed by a systems administrator.
For larger newsrooms, there may be a team of systems admins, but
at least one person within the organization will need to serve
as the administrator. In some situations, such as smaller news
organizations where a journalist has the technical capacity
to administer systems, one person can serve as both Journalist
and Administrator. When possible, we advise having a dedicated
staff member serving the role of SecureDrop Administrator.
The admin uses a dedicated Admin Workstation running
Tails, connects to the Application and
Monitor Servers over authenticated onion services, and manages them
using Ansible.
If you are considering becoming a SecureDrop administrator, below are some
attributes that will be important to have:
Experience with managing Linux-based systems from the command line.
Proficiency with network hardware such as firewalls and switches
(e.g. pfSense).
Experience with configuration management tools such as Ansible, Salt, Chef,
or Puppet.
Ability to use and configure secure communication tools such as GPG.
We consider the first two requirements and the second two preferred attributes.
This Admin Guide will walk you through the entire experience,
from planning to installation to deployment, and will also provide reference
materials to help ensure that your servers remain up-to-date and in
proper working order.

	When we tuned into the 2024 Screen Actor Guild Awards, better known as the SAG Awards, we were excited to see all the red carpet looks, the touching speeches, and more. But what we didn’t expect to see was two of our favorite A-listers revealing they’re in the same parenting group together!

	










	In case you missed it, Bradley Cooper crashed Jessica Chastain’s interview with Elaine Welteroth for the pre-show and when Cooper and Chastain were reunited, Chastain dropped the bombshell: “We’re in the same kids group.”

	“We sure are, for many years now,” Cooper added, with Chastain clarifying, saying, “We have, like, a PTA.”



	Can you imagine how cool that PTA must be?! Who are the other stars in it? Are their daughter’s friends? The two stars barely said anything about the subject, but fans are dying to know more. (But, we did get Cooper revealing how supportive Chastain has been over the years, with him quipping: “She’s been so supportive for years!”)





	For those who don’t know, Cooper shares one daughter named Lea de Seine, born in March 2017, with his ex Irina Shayk. Chastain has two children with her husband, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo: a daughter named Giulietta Passi Chastain, born in late 2018, and a son named Augustus Passi, born sometime in 2022.

	While their daughters have a year difference from each other, parenting groups don’t separate it all by every year of age, just by what stage their kiddos are in, and we love that Chastain and Cooper have each other’s backs when navigating their growing daughters. (And we love this meetup at the SAG Awards!)

I/O is a technology-centered project to cultivate autonomy in our communities. We connect grassroots organizations, nonprofits, and community members with free resources on technology, including info sessions, educational materials, and workshops.
When we meet, we set a space where we as individuals and small organizations become more aware of the power in our everyday tech and personal devices, and practice utilizing that power for the betterment of our lives and communities.
Our events are free to attend, with a suggested donation of $10.
Here you will find links to helpful resources, as well as instructions on how to subscribe to our calendar of events.
We hosted programs (nearly) every Sunday from 2:30–6pm at one of several locally-owned venues. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are not meeting in person. Instead, we encourage you to visit TechLearningCollective.com for quality online/remote IT educational workshops. When we (eventually) meet in person, we alternate between programming that is generally oriented towards Individuals (I) and programming that is generally oriented towards organizations (O) or collectives.
Of course, anyone can attend either type of gathering — this distinction is made only to help you scope what you would like to attend, and the things you would like to learn. When the topic appeals to both, the event will be marked “I/O.”
In computing, I/O is short for “input/output,” and is used regularly across a variety of contexts, but most often refers to some kind of exchange between external devices and internal devices, or, moreover, between machines and humans. It is this very exchange we concern ourselves with. “Io” is also the name of Jupiter’s innermost moon. The moon was named after a mortal figure in Greek mythology, who befriends imprisoned Prometheus, and whose descendent, Heracles, eventually frees him.
We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. Our programs are not part of a “bootcamp” or coding school. We are not recruiters; we actively discourage everyone from getting jobs in the “Tech” sector. If you are employed by organizations in the tech industry, please be advised that our ideology is hostile to you or your employer’s profit motive, and that we are committed to shunning common behaviors that we have seen rewarded in many other “tech” groups. Among other things, this means we strictly enforce our no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.
Racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, capitalist advocacy, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from the venue and you will be asked never to return. Starting arguments that hijack the experience of others, speaking condescendingly, or acting in ways that makes others less able to learn will result in the same. Never take a learning opportunity away from another participant, no matter how smart you need everyone to think you are.
We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s  actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive. If this sounds like you, welcome. If not, there are plenty of other places you can go.
During the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are no longer meeting in person. Instead, we encourage you to visit TechLearningCollective.com for quality IT educational webinars and special events.

NMIS's New Home - We are moving the support and related information
      	to opmantek.com and here you will find the latest information on NMIS.
      

NMIS 8.4.2 General Release is available, you can get if from Opmantek.com


All new NMIS releases will be available from Opmantek.com


NMIS is 14 years old




          Download NMIS 8.3.1 18 September 2011
        


The software has been released to the Public Domain under the GPL
    License. This means that it is free if you agree to the terms of the GPL
    License. If you would like the software under a different agreement please contact
    Keith Sinclair. 
NB: NMIS began as a hobby for Keith Sinclair.  Keith says "I have
      released this software as I wanted to contribute
      something back to the Network Management Community which has helped me. 
    Guys like Tobias Oetiker!" Development continues at SourceForge (see above).For more Cisco oriented NMS
      software try Cisco-centric Open Source Exchange Community.

    NMIS stands for Network Management Information System.  It is a Network
    Management System which performs multiple functions from the OSI Network Management
    Functional Areas, those being, Performance, Configuration, Fault.
It started as a SNMP polling and statistics viewer front-end to Tobi
    Oetiker's RRDTool.  RRDTool replaces MRTG but doesn't
    include a front end and backend to handle SNMP polling and display resulting web pages
    etc.  The original NMIS evolved quite rapidly to meet demands of production
    environments.  The backend, polling engine, uses SNMP to collect interface and health
    statistics for Cisco Routers, certain Cisco Catalyst Switches and Generic SNMP devices
    every 5 minutes.  
The backend stores the statistics in RRD's (Round Robin Databases)
    and ensures that devices are up, issues alerts, etc.  The
    front end accesses the information stored in the RRD's and displays statistics the
    resulting graphs, reports, etc.  
Both the front and back ends are highly extensible and features are
    easy to add as the structure is learnt.  For example the backend was just collecting
    interface statistics every poll cycle, it was easy to add collection of health (cpu,
    memory, buffer, etc) and response time, availability.
I will continue to spell out more about NMIS but for now, have a
    look at the Features and Benefits, Install it and see what it can do.
NMIS is released as GPL
    software, please ensure that you read the license as by using this software you are bound
    by it.
NMIS 4 is available via cvs on sourceforge!
NOTE: Lots of NMIS has been deprecated!  Things that I
          wanted to do have been done, code simplified, filenames changed and
          lots of things.  This has been done to improve and simplify NMIS
          but will be that if you have an existing NMIS running you will need to
          implement the new NMIS carefully. 
NOTE: FOR ANYONE UPGRADING TO NMIS 2.0 ENSURE YOU CHECK ALL
          CONFIG ITEMS.
NOTE: Changes now tracked in the Change Log.
With all the changes NMIS appears to be HEAPS faster!
Many new config options and configuration items exist.
Configuration validation routine for ensuring that NMIS is
          configured properly.
Updated whole bunches of nmiscgi.pl, updated the style and
          revamped it a little bit, looks a bit better now.
Updated logs.pl with a better parsing algorithm, handles the
          weird messages in syslog which routers and switches send.
Added map.pl which enables NMIS to display group status colored
          icons for each group on a HTML map using CSS.  Icons will change
          color with group status, also display summary network metrics and
          allows drill in to NMIS for each group. (not auto-discovery or drag
          and drop).  Adds a bunch of config.dat elements and requires
          setting up map.csv with icon placement co-ordinates.
Added summary.pl which is a very basic NMIS CGI interface for WAP
          and Palm type devices or low bandwidth connections.
NMIS has had many updates and changes since this sample was produced
      but this is still representative of what NMIS looks like and does.
NMIS is often run on Linux PC platforms but has also been run on higher
      end Sun Microsystems machines.  Memory is more important then CPU in
      this case.  Performance for polling is dependant on many things but
      usually limited by how long it actually takes to poll each device for the
      required SNMP statistics.  Generally speaking any Pentium II or
      UltraSparc should be able to manage about 100 to 200 nodes.  The
      faster the machine the more memory should equal more nodes.  This
      will obviously reach some sort of law of diminishing returns.
NMIS attempts to be fully validated HTML but does not promise to comply
      completely at present due to the large amount of HTML embedded in the CGI
      scripts.
Why write yet another piece of Network Management Software? 
      Simple, most Network Management Software does one thing, focuses on an
      element from the OSI
      Network Mangement Reference Model.  This means that you end up
      with lots of different bits of software running, all of them polling the
      network and they all have to be integrated.  NMIS is trying to meet
      the requirements of several functional areas from the OSI network
      management model.At the moment this is Performance Management and Fault
      Management and a little Configuration Management.  That is why NMIS
      was written, to fill in the gaps and provide one system which will meet a
      large number requirements and functions of network management.  NMIS
      is also aiming to be proactive, provide reporting and give the status of
      the network "at a glance fashion".The at a glance is a
      dashboard of the network with operational status of all network devices
      and the groups which those devices belong to.  NMIS could be
      considered an API for network management, get the polling engine to
      collect and monitor, using RRDTool as the database, then access this
      information in any way you like to display status, statistics, etc.

Everything you ve ever wanted to know about the Chip Instant Access Account and open banking. New terms in effect from 7 March 2023: Chip Instant Access Terms Aug 2023(ClearBank)
Our Chip Instant Access account is an instant-access savings account paying a 4.84% AER on your deposited funds which is paid monthly. All with full FSCS protection on your deposits. Subject to eligibility, please see above section "Covered by FSCS" for more information.
The Bank of England Bank Rate, often simply referred to as the base rate, is the interest rate at which the Bank of England lends money to commercial banks. It serves as a benchmark for all other interest rates in the economy, influencing the rates that banks offer on their lending and savings products.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), a group within the Bank of England, sets the base rate based on economic conditions, with the primary aim of managing inflation. MPC decisions are widely reported on and their meeting notes are a matter of public record. 
Yes. There are no fees or charges for holding this account. Please see our pricing page for general fee information. Please note that our Saving Plans features do carry fees. Â 
We calculate the interest you are due on your balance each day. We then pay the interest monthly on the 4th working day of the following month. To find out more about different deposit times click here.âAER is the rate of interest you earn on any balance above Â£0 in the Chip Instant Access Account. It stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and shows the interest rate for a year, and reflects compounding (earning interest on interest), taking into account any interest payments made to you during the year.With a 4.84% AER interest rate, if you put in Â£1,000 on your first day, you'd earn Â£48.40 in interest over the year. If nothing changes (including the interest rate), you'd have Â£1,048.40 at the end of the year. There is no minimum deposit for interest to begin accruing.AER enables you to compare the interest rates on accounts from different banks and building societies where interest may be calculated or paid at different frequencies. But there is also a gross interest rate, which is the rate youâll earn before compounding is reflected. UK bank interest is paid gross. For example if AER is 4.84%, the gross interest rate is 4.74%.
Yes, the Chip Instant Access Account rate is variable. That means we can change it up or down at our discretion.Youâll have likely seen that we aim to follow movements from the Bank of England base rate of interest, but weâll also take the easy-access savings market into consideration too, in order to ensure Chip customers always get a competitive rate of interest.Should Chip set a date to lower the interest rate, you will be given a minimum of 14 daysâ notice. You may receive less notice if the rate increases.
The eligible balance of your account has Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection up to Â£85,000, which also includes the interest accredited to the account each month. You can read more about how we protect your money here.
Yes, you can autosave directly into this account (Savings Plans settings can be found on the profile tab) and also perform manual saves at any time should you wish by selecting the account in the savings tab and tapping âdepositâ. Saves into this account also count toward your in-app savings goals that you can set up in the âGoalsâ tab. Please see our pricing plan page for further information.
You can open and manage any savings account in Chip on behalf of someone else, but you will need Power of Attorney over the account holderâs financial affairs. In order to set up or manage an account for someone using Power of Attorney you will need to talk to our customer support team via in-app chat or by emailing hello@getchip.ukâThe team will walk you through the process, but they will ask for a few documents to prove you have Power of Attorney:- An ID document of both you (the person acting as Attorney) and the account holder- A proof of address for you (the person acting as Attorney)- A Lasting Power of Attorney document (LPA) for Property and Financial Affairs

To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:


As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source
code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
contributors.


Specifically, the provision reads:

      * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
      *    must display the following acknowledgement:
      *    This product includes software developed by the University of
      *    California, Berkeley and its contributors.

Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
in its entirety.

The Fine Print: The following comments are owned by whoever posted them.  We are not responsible for them in any way.

Maybe... But, you could look at it this way: You might think you are denying someone else these all-important rights, but in reality, it would only apply to your modifications.
Before anyone goes ballistic, I understand that the license doesn't say this in any way. However, as long as the original source is still around, anyone can grab the original and have the same rights you had/have. The only exception: your modifications.
Just because you can fork off a new BSD derivative and deny people access to the source code doesn't mean people have to use it. There will have to be a good reason (new features, improvements, etc.) for people to choose it. If people are paying for BSDI when a free version is available, that's their choice. (Besides, how much is Red Hat worth today? Don't think they didn't "profit from" somebody's work. They may "give back to the community", but I haven't seen millions of dollars or millions of dollars worth of code coming from there.)
If you're troubled about Windows, Mac, Solaris, etc., don't think they're doing so well just because a little BSD code got in there. Though BSD folks might think so. ;) Realistically, a lot of work has gone into these operating systems, and they offer different features than xBSD.
Note: I'm not trying to knock the GPL here or start (join) a flame war. I just think that some of these arguments against BSD are ignoring common sense.
This is the one thing I hate about Linux and its groupies. So many greedy, snotty, self-rightous #&@$! "Free - forever." Have you actually *read* the GPL? Maybe I've always had a different definition for freedom, maybe that's why ESR had to make a witty statement to help define what freedom means in the GPL. Who knows.. its Orwellian. "Freedom is Slavery."
And before I get bogged with hateful messages, some script kiddy trying to send me a flash email, etc, let me say one thing. I do know people who are not like what I despise (above) who favor Linux, I am on two LUGs, I even tried to get to LinuxWorld, and I have multiple (4) distributions of Linux. I also have over a dozen Linux books. But I also prefer *BSD's culture, no matter what ESR and RMS like to demean it as. There, kill me. You zealots are going to be the ones who make 1984 a reality.
 BSD is a proven well head for Sun, HP, Microsoft, SCO, and every other software vendor. You code BSD, they build products using it. BSD was the conduit for goverment funded software research. Fine. 
 I am not a "blind follower" of the GPL. I, and other GPL contributers are capitalists in every sense of the word. They've figured out there is zero potential return on their investment under BSD. They know they can't compete on the basis of selling their software product for cash. So, the GPL allows them to sell their software product for profit in the form of services. They get bug fixes, enhancements, and noteriaty in return for their investment. 
 Under a capitalistic system, people who perform any service without maximizing their potential return are failures, by definition. Users of the GPL reviewed their options, and took an action they believe maximized their return. 
 So, what economic system do you work under that associates bright thinking with giving your profitable work away for a guarenteed zero return?
 I'm not sure if I understand you, but you seem to be saying that people who BSDL their code really don't want other people to take advantage of it with a less free license. But this contradicts several of the assertions made by BSDL advocates in this forum that specifically say they don't mind if this happens. 
 For the record I have absolutely nothing against the BSD license. What irritates me is people who advocate the BSDL as being "more free" on the one hand, and then turn around and go ape-shit when someone wants to include BSD code in a GPL program. 
 I've actually seen one person suggest that a clause be added to the BSD license that specificly prohibits use in GPL code! Hey pal, you've just reinvented the GPL, moron.
 UCB has only removed demands for credit to the University of California. Other people who have added code to BSD have inserted demands for credit to them, and for such code, the advertising clause is still in effect. 
 For code that only demands credit to Berkeley, the conflict is gone and it can now be freely linked to GPL code.
Sorry Millennium, but I didn't quite catch your point. I wasn't really talking about ownership. I was addressing the common complaint that people don't want someone else making a million dollars off of their code. That's their business and that's fine. But when people start using the words "deny" and "rights" to promote the GPL or discredit BSD style licenses, that's when the piles other than socks start getting deep.
More importantly, I think the socks example can be very misleading. I can duplicate an entire software product without modifying the original. With a pile of socks, I cannot. This makes all the difference.
The important point here is that no one is going to modify the original BSD source base and eliminate our rights to it. If the someone copies BSD, modifies it, and sells it, they are obviously not modifying the original copy. The BSD groups themselves maintain the original copies. And technically, anyone with a copy of the source trees helps ensure that we do not lose the original source and license.
To make the socks example fit better, imagine someone can duplicate your entire pile of socks without touching your pile. They then add 2 socks. Somehow, they deny the public rights related to their pile. What rights have they really denied the public? The difference between your free pile and their non-free pile is 2 socks. 2 socks only. Their modifications only. That's it. That is why I claim that the rights issue only involves their modifications (2 socks in this example). And hey, aren't those 2 socks their business? Who are we to demand that they give us the source to their additions?
If the additions are useful and they won't give them to us, someone will duplicate it in a free form. However, if the proprietary group couldn't have made the additions proprietary in the first place, don't think they would naturally have written them and given them away. The idea might have been lost for good. Let them make want they want. They have an economic incentive to try things. The things that work eventually make it into free source.
From this point of view, there is no issue at all. The "problem" doesn't exist. If we're trying to promote free software, let's write some free software. If we're trying to push some other agenda, perhaps our software licenses are not the best avenue.

And technically, anyone with a copy of the source trees helps ensure that we do not lose the original source and license.
To make the socks example fit better, imagine someone can duplicate your entire pile of socks without touching your pile. They then add 2 socks. Somehow, they deny the public rights related to their pile. What rights have they really denied the public? The difference between your free pile and their non-free pile is 2 socks. 2 socks only. Their modifications only. That's it. That is why I claim that the rights issue only involves their modifications (2 socks in this example). And hey, aren't those 2 socks their business? Who are we to demand that they give us the source to their additions?
From this point of view, there is no issue at all. The "problem" doesn't exist. If we're trying to promote free software, let's write some free software. If we're trying to push some other agenda, perhaps our software licenses are not the best avenue.

Sorry Millennium, but I didn't quite catch your point. I wasn't really talking about ownership. I was addressing the common complaint that people don't want someone else making a million dollars off of their code. That's their business and that's fine. But when people start using the words "deny" and "rights" to promote the GPL or discredit BSD style licenses, that's when the piles other than socks start getting deep.
More importantly, I think the socks example can be very misleading. I can duplicate an entire software product without modifying the original. With a pile of socks, I cannot. This makes all the difference.

 You won't get argument from me that someone shouldn't modify the PNG library, making it 10x faster or some such nonsense, then claim it as their own and not redistribute their changes. But you will get arguments from me when you claim that my 100k line program must be GPLd if I use 'readline'. Its not that the software must be kept free that people usually argue with the GPL, but that it takes away the right you have to do what you want with your OWN software, independant of the GPLd code.
HOWEVER, this does not prevent them from granting blanket permission to anyone to use UC Berkeley-Copyrighted code under the old license (this does not include things such as Apache for example but would affect things such as ash, the BSD /bin/sh) under the new one. 
AFAIK, the FreeBSD project at least is already using a 3-clause BSD license for new code, but they could not previously grant use of the original BSD code under those terms---not that it really matters to them from a legal standpoint, but the advertising clause IS somewhat inconvenient and ineffectual IMO. Where this change REALLY benefits anyone (and the reason Richard Stallman was pushing for it) is in terms of GPL compatibility. The new BSD license is compatible with the GPL. This means libreadline linked bash, among other things.
 This remark makes no sense whatsoever. The BSD license already permits extensions to be totally proprietary. Why do BSD advocates care if someone makes an extension or fork off the BSD tree and GPLs it, when they don't object to someone who makes a fork off the tree that is totally proprietary? 
 It's really strange. BSDers politely request people to give their changes back, but if they choose not to (e.g. put the code into Solaris or some such) they don't object. But they scream if someone takes the same code and puts it into a GPL program. This is stupid. Even if BSD people can't use the code directly, they can study it for ideas, which is something that they can't do with proprietary extensions. (And yes, BSD snobs, BSD kernel developers have learned a considerable amount from work that first appeared in the Linux space, and of course considerable knowledge has flowed the other way as well). 
 If someone takes a BSD distribution and slaps the GPL on it, the original BSD distribution is still available. Note that RMS does not advocate doing things like this; while he prefers copyleft, he thinks that cooperation with the maintainers of non-copylefted free software and avoiding forks is more important. But if someone else does it, it really doesn't matter.
 The BSD license permits someone to add new code to existing BSD code, and then to add a new license, as long as the original notice is kept. If you think that it is wrong for someone to use this permission, it follows that you think BSD licensing is wrong. 
 BSDers don't care at all if the license on the derivative work says "All rights reserved", no copying or distribution, pay thousands of dollars, go to jail if you break it. But they scream, scream, scream if the new license says "GPL". Why is this? 
 Please note: I don't want to change your sacred license. I got my degree at Berkeley, and I produced vast amounts of free software with a license just like what BSD is now (we never had the advertising clause). But if someone made a derivative work of my code and put the GPL on it, I wouldn't object in any way.
Besides being morally repugnant (the author released the code under that license for a reason), it is illegal for anyone other than the author(s) of a piece of code or binary to alter a license in ANY WAY (including Microsoft, SUN, BSDI, etc.). The main problem with the arguments of the proponents of GPLing BSDL source is that they assume a license completely ignores any previous rights given by copyright law. They assume that if it isn't explicitly stated in the license, a right is forfeit. It isn't. In fact, the opposite is true. Part (d) of section 201, Title 17 of the United States Code deals with the transfer of copyright rights and reads:   "(d) TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.-- (1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession. (2) Any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, including any subdivi-sion of any of the rights specified by section 106, may be transferred as provided by clause (1) and owned separately. The owner of any particular exclusive right is entitled, to the extent of that right, to all of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by this title."  There is nothing special about a license. It is simply a temporary grant of the rights entitled by a copyright holder. A licensee only gets the rights explicitly specified in the license. In fact, a license CANNOT give you the right to change the license. That is a right of ownership of the copyright, and as stated in Section 101, Title 17, USC, the definition of a "transfer of copyright ownership" excludes nonexclusive licenses (which software licenses are, by definition). So if a license gave you the right, it wouldn't be legally binding, and any subsequent sub-licensing would likewise be legally invalid. This is an area that I would be interested in seeing how the courts have defined. Furthermore, a person cannot GPL changes or additions made to BSDL code. Those are considered derivative works, and, as granted in subsection (c) of section 106, Title 17, USC, they are the exclusive right of the copyright owner. So, those would have to be BSDL, as well. The only way someone could GPL any BSDL code is if they created an entirely new work (not derivative) and their use of BSDL'd code passed the fair use test [benedict.com]. As an aside, derivative works aren't well defined in the law (what happens to derivative works not created by the author, for example), so it would be interesting to see how the courts have defined this area. Also, code changes are a special case and could probably be further defined. Based on my interpretation of the law, changes made to either BSDL or GPL code would be copyrighted by the original author of the code, which seems excessive. (Anybody out there know how the courts have ruled?)  Whatever your feelings on GPL and BSDL, I think everyone can agree they represent very different philosophies for "free" software. To try to change the license of an author's code, even if it wasn't illegal, is wrong. The author made a choice, one that should be respected. By trying to change the license, a person is trying to take away an author's right to make that choice. That is why BSD people get so upset when someone tries to GPL BSDL code, for those of you that had to ask.  Responses are welcome. I am certainly not an authority on the subject, I just did a little research. I am especially interested in the case law, which I know absolutely nothing about. If any one is aware of how copyright law has been interpreted by the courts and how that might apply to this situation, I would love to hear from you.

  The fact that SGI choose the GPL over the BSD licence to release their code under is proof that it's the BSD license that's seriously broken despite what idiots like yourself claim.  I suspect the value judgment you're claiming never entered anyone's mind at SGI; rather, the lawyers took one look at the situation and decided that using any other license than the GPV for code to be integrated into Linux created a legal minefield they'd much rather stay away from. That's the lawyerly thing to do.--
For the same reasons you use the GPL in the first place! 
What can you not do with the GPL that you can with the BSD? You can't not give someone the source to the program if they ask for it and you have given them the compiled form. 
Now, a better question: Why would anyone want to use the BSD license for their code instead of the GPL? So other people can make changes, and not give them back? 
It just doesn't make sense.
 As for people's fears that some evil company will take BSDL code and proprietarize/commercialize it, and for their assertions that GPL prevents that, bah! If _I_ were an evil software company, I wouldn't *care* whether the code I stole was GPL'ed or QJX'ed or whatever. I would just steal it and meld it with my own code, with only a few trustworthy programmers having to know.  
Why will you trust them if they have perfect material to blackmail you?
 Now do you see why Berkeley is dumping the restriction?
 True, but in that case, the FSF owned the copyright to the entire program, and hence were free to offer new license terms as they saw fit.
  Many, including Richard Stallman, have criticized the BSD license due to its demand for credit in advertising. Since this is the only restriction on further redistribution, the BSDs are the only freely re-distributable operating systems in common use. However, due to the advertising clause, FreeBSD cannot simply tack the GPL onto the existing license. The GPL prohibits this. Much new development removes the advertising clause of the copyright statement.  
 So, now that the advertising clause is gone, does this mean that FreeBSD can simply tack the GPL onto the existing license?
 See my earlier comment. All UCB are doing (in fact, all they can do) is offering to relicense the code on which they own the copyright under the new terms. Although many programs use the BSD license, UCB don't own copyright on most of them, and hence have no say in future licensing terms. 
Individuals authors will have to rerelease the source under the new license terms (or offer to relicense existing source under the new terms). No doubt some will do so, and some will not -- either because they want the advertising clause present (and they have every right to do so), or because they don't know or don't care about it.
 I, for one, don't have any particular axe to grind. I like the BSD license, but I generally prefer the GPL license, because it discourages forking and keeps source code open. 
 BSD license is more favorable (at least under certain circumstances) to software developers. GPL license is more favorable to software users. 
 Pick the one you like. If something is released under a license/policy you don't like, don't use it. That's what I do, and is why I generally avoid closed-source software.  --Interested in XFMail? New XFMail home page [slappy.org]

 NO. It doesn't mean that. It is not desirable for FreeBSD to change to the GPL, and that will never happen. Trust me on this. And you can't just tack on the license. It just doesn't work that way. Berkeley still owns the copyright to many files so FreeBSD could not change things like that. If any of the Linux people think they can just "tack the GPL on" to the file, they are flat wrong, plain and simple. Licensing terms are controlled exclusively by the copyright holder. 
 Many people use FreeBSD specifically because it has a proprietary friendly license. One company I know if actively modifies the kernel to get the best performance they can out of their video hardware. And the do not want to make all of those changes available. Many aren't relevant to a general purpose OS, and some document interfaces to their priorietary system. The GPL has to much ambiguity to base a business plan on. Linus Torvalds says it means one think while RMS says it means another. 
 No. FreeBSD will never be GPL'd.

Leave it to the God of Mischief to make a mess of the multiverse and fall in love with his own variant, all in a single season of TV.Â 
Thor's trickster sibling (played by Tom Hiddleston) has always had a nose for trouble in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but "Loki" season 1 saw him take his talent for sowing chaos to new heights. Along the way, the show surrounded the character with a ragtag group of (mostly) lovable allies and frenemies, from the plucky agents at the Time Variance Authority to alternate versions of himself that include a kid and an alligator, because why not? Thankfully, most of the crew will be back for season 2, save for those who perished in season 1. (Then again, death is a relative concept in the MCU, so who knows?)

In an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel LiveÂ (via ComicBook.com), Hiddleston confirmed the main cast of "Loki" season 1 will return for season 2, stating, "It's great having everybody back." He refrained from revealing much beyond that (Marvel Studios does love its secrets), but affirmed the show is moving production from Atlanta to London for its next batch of episodes. When asked if that was done to accommodate the actor, who resides in London, Hiddleston replied, "I think it was just an accident of scheduling, but I'm thrilled about it."

Among the "Loki" season 1 stars expected to join Tom Hiddleston in the cast for season 2 are Owen Wilson as the rarely-unfazed Time Variance Authority agent Mobius M. Mobius, Wunmi Mosaku as the no-nonsene TVA warrior Hunter B-15, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the (usually) dignified TVA judge Ravonna Renslayer, Sophia Di Martino as Loki's independent-minded variant Sylvie, and Tara Strong as the voice of the TVA's animated (in more senses than one)Â mascot Miss Minutes. Of course, some of them will be playing variants of their characters in season 2, as part of an alternate timeline overseen by the He Who Remains' (Jonathan Majors) variant (Kang?) that was glimpsed in the season 1 finale.

Behind the camera, the "Loki" season 2 cast will be joined by "Loki" season 1 staff writer Eric Martin, taking over as head writer for Michael Waldron (who will continue to serve as an executive producer on the heels of writing "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"). Season 1 director Kate Herron has similarly been replaced by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, the filmmakers who directed the most mind-bending episode of "Moon Knight," the genre-blending "The Tomb." With those two at the helm, I remain hopeful "Loki" season 2 will be willing to push the envelope a little further (for the MCU anyway) than the otherwise-enjoyable season 1 did and give us a series as wild as a show about a trouble-making alien tumbling through time and space really ought to be.

"Loki" season 1 is now streaming on Disney+. Season 2 has set to receive a premiere date.

Betting on whether a specific player will score more or fewer points than a predetermined total set by the sportsbook.
Similar to a player's points over/under, this involves predicting whether a player will secure more or fewer rebounds than a specified number.
Betting on whether a player will record more or fewer assists than a set number provided by the sportsbook.
Wagering on the number of 3-point shots a player will make during the game, with an over/under line set by the sportsbook.
Betting on whether a player will achieve a double-double (reaching double digits in two statistical categories, usually points and rebounds or points and assists) or a triple-double (reaching double digits in three statistical categories).
Predicting which player will score the first points in the game. This type of bet can be extremely difficult to predict, so they can have larger payouts.
Pick the exact way the first basket is made, typically choosing a player and then whether he'll make a free throw, dunk, layup, three-point shot, or other basket.
Comparing the individual performances of two players, such as who will score more points, grab more rebounds, or record more assists in the game.
A type of bet that allows you to combine multiple player-related outcomes within a single wager. This can include various individual player performance factors such as points scored, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and other statistical categories.
Oddsmakers set a line for the total points that they expect one team to score. For example, if the line for Los Angeles is 125.5 points, you can bet on whether Los Angeles will score more (over) or fewer (under) points than that specified line.
Betting on whether a basketball team will exceed or fall short of a specified total in terms of rebounds or assist
While there is an outright winner and loser in basketball games, there is also a winner and loser against the spread. This refers to the point spread that is determined by oddsmakers and the betting market. If Boston is -3.5, it is a 3.5-point favorite and must win by four points or more to cover
Betting on the outright winner of the game without any point spread involved. Each team is assigned odds, and you bet on the team you think will win.
This involves betting on the total number of points scored in a game. Sportsbooks set a total, and you can bet on whether the combined score of both teams will be over or under that posted number.
A parlay is a single bet that combines two or more individual wagers for a bigger payout. All bets in the parlay must be successful for the overall bet to win.
A type of sports betting wager where a bettor combines multiple bets on a single game into a single wager. Unlike traditional parlays, where bets are placed on separate games, a same game parlay allows you to combine various bets within a single game, such as team point spreads, player props, over/under totals, and more.
These are bets on specific events within a game, like the first team to score, total points by a player, or the result of the first quarter.
While many bets are posted for individual games, there are also futures bets that often span multiple weeks or months. Common basketball futures bets are division winners and championship winners. Futures bets can be hard to predict, so they can have large payouts.
Placing bets on the outcome of the game or specific aspects of the game at halftime or during a particular quarter.
Pre-game betting is still the most common way to bet on a game, but live betting has created a chance for bettors to wager throughout the contest. Sportsbooks update the money line, spread, and over/under throughout the game for users to bet on in real time.
This is the most common type of basketball bet. The sportsbook sets a margin of victory, and you can bet on a team to win by more points (cover the spread) or lose by fewer points than the set margin.
When the final margin of victory lands exactly on the point spread or total. The bet is neither a winner nor a loser, meaning bets are refunded.

In anaerobic bioreactors, microbes metabolize organic contaminants in sewage and industrial wastewaters to produce clean water and energy-yielding methane. They can be more economical and efficient than aerobic reactors, which use oxygen and require energy rather than yielding it. The widespread success of this biotechnology traces to the lab of Professor Emeritus Perry McCarty.
This cylinder is a model of an âanaerobic filter,â developed with James Young in 1969. Wastewater flows up through a bed of rocks, where it encounters a symbiotic ecosystem with numerous microbial species occupying the gaps. The effluent is harvestable methane and water freed from organic contaminants.
In the early 1980s, McCarty with Andre Bachmann invented an alternative: the baffled reactor. This box-shaped reactor is the actual model used to test this concept. It forces wastewater over and under the baffles, where contaminants are metabolized. With different mixtures of microbes, these reactors can remove chlorinated solvents and organic wastes. McCartyâs awards for his work include the Tyler Prize and the Stockholm Water Prize.

These definitive six volumes on aerodynamic theory were conceived, edited and partly written by William F. Durand in the 1930s. In 1939, Durand gave the books to graduate student (now Professor Emeritus) Walter Vincenti. Like many, Vincenti regards Durand as a hero to be emulated. In a 2007 lecture, Vincenti pointed out that Durandâs approach to engineering was even more important than his results. Vincenti quoted a tribute to Durand by the famed engineer Theodore von Karman: âDurandâs major influence was in bringing about in America a transition from purely empirical, practical engineering to a physically understood scientific engineering.â

In 1916, with support from NASAâs precursor, William F. Durand and Everett P. Lesley embarked on tests that would have fundamental application in aeronautics for decades. They built a wind tunnel and measured the performance of scores of different propellers. Their rigorous and comprehensive data enabled airplane designers all over the world to choose the best propellers for their specific airframe designs. The propeller in the display is an unconventional model from Durandâs tests. More conventional models are on display in the Engineering Library.

In 1996, PhD students Sergey Brin and Larry Page invented the PageRank algorithm. Their work in this area was supported by Professors Hector Garcia-Molina, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey Ullman and Terry Winograd. The algorithm ranks web pages that match search terms by assessing breadth and depth of public interest in that web content. Because much disk space was needed to test PageRank on actual World Wide Web data, Sergey and Larry assembled 10 of the largest drives available (4 gigabytes each) into this low-cost cabinet, whimsically decorated with toy building blocks. Their software could then index 24 million pages a week (at the time, a massive number).
As a result of their initial work at Stanford, the two founded a company called Google in 1998. By 2008, Google reported that its thousands of servers had indexed more than a trillion unique pages.

As electrical engineering undergraduates and graduate students at Stanford in the 1930s, William Hewlett and David Packard encountered three influences that would guide the rest of their lives: the excitement of technology, an entrepreneurial spirit in the emerging field of electronics, and each otherâs friendship. With help and inspiration from Professor Fred Terman, Packard and Hewlett co-founded an electronics company in 1939 in a garage on Addison Street in Palo Alto. They didnât have much â a little more than $500 and a used drill press. A prominent fixture of the garage was a simple, gray workbench, where the pair of engineers toiled to produce whatever âwould bring in a nickel.â One of their earlier customers was the Walt Disney Co., which bought oscillators for the classic movie âFantasia.â

Many problems of minimizing costs, or developing plans that optimize some other objective, are best modeled by linear programming and solved by the Simplex Method. George Dantzig, inventor of the method, taught at Stanford from 1966 to 1996 and was the first to state the general linear programming problem. He published the seminal text Linear Programming and Extensions in 1963.
In their work Principles of Engineering Economy, Eugene L. Grant and W. Grant Ireson discuss how engineers can make sound and profitable decisions on capital investments rather than succumb to dangerous âhunches.â Grant first published the book in 1930. Ireson joined as an author in later versions, such as this fourth edition published in 1960.
In the early 1960s, as the operations research department germinated at Stanford, inaugural chair Gerald Lieberman and Frederick Hillier published Introduction to Operations Research, a profoundly influential text. Now in its ninth edition, the bookâs recognitions include the 2004 Expository Writing Award of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.

The structure and properties of materials arise from the arrangement of their atoms and molecules. Because structural features can be billionths of a meter -- or ânanometersâ -- long, the study of their all-important arrangements is called nanocharacterization. Stanford has been a leading institution in the field for decades.
In 1982, for example, researchers led by Professor Robert Sinclair used an electron microscope to record real-time video of atomic-scale structural changes occurring in a cadmium telluride crystal. These images are frames from one of those movies.
IBM engineer Mary Doerner and Stanford Professor William Nix in 1986 demonstrated how to infer properties of materials using a nanoindenter, which plunges a diamond tip into a material. The behavior during denting and forming tiny pits, such as these stamped in brass, reveal how nanometer-scale processes affect a materialâs hardness.
Today hundreds of researchers use shared facilities, such as the Stanford Nanocharacterization Lab, for nanoscience experiments considered fundamental to advances in energy, medicine and information technology.

Stanford engineers have been innovators in the field of data networks for decades, making important technical contributions and launching influential enterprises.
In 1974, a team including mathematics alumnus and former Professor Vint Cerf  developed the specification for the Transmission Control Protocol, allowing the ARPANET packet-switched network to become interconnected with other networks, enabling the creation of the Internet. TCP/IP remains a fundamental set of rules for inter-computer communication on the Internet. The Birth of the Internet plaque acknowledges the contributions of many people associated with TCP development at Stanford.
Two of Cerfâs graduate students, Ron Crane and Yogen Dalal, in 1977 joined Stanford Consulting Professor Bob Metcalfe and alumnus David Boggs at Xeroxâs Palo Alto Research Center to commercialize their invention called Ethernet. Today it is the standard for moving data around enterprises and homes and is a key component of the Internet. Metcalfe and Crane went on to start 3Com in 1980, and alumnus Dado Banatao built the first Ethernet chip at seeq in 1982. This gold-plated 3Com Ethernet card is part of a larger gift to this building by many Stanford faculty and alumni instrumental in Ethernetâs success. The first floor lobby in this building is named to honor Ethernet. The larger circuit board shown here is a 3mb Ethernet card built by Stanford computer science staff and students in the mid-1980s (more displays of historic networking equipment are on the first floor of the Gates Building).
In 1981, inspired by Ethernet and the fledgling Internet, alumni Judy Estrin and Eric Benhamou and two other entrepreneurs co-founded Bridge Communications to make servers and routers to move data within and between networks. In 1984, alumnus Leonard Bosack and his, wife Sandy Lerner, left computer operations staff jobs at Stanford to found an Internet router company called Cisco, which has become the dominant company in the industry. They adapted the multi-protocol router software developed some years earlier at Stanford by William Yeager. The large white âboxâ shown here is a Cisco router that connected Stanfordâs Ethernets to the Internet.
The Internet connection for hundreds of millions of people around the world is via DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) technology, which enables high-speed data transmission over standard telephone lines. The technology standard in use today was invented by Professor Emeritus John Cioffi and student Peter Chow in 1992. This circuit board, meant to be installed as the telephone companyâs central office connection to a customer, includes original chips based on the work they did at Stanford and commercialized as Amati Communications Corp. (later sold to Texas Instruments).
Stanford innovations have also extended to wireless networking. Atheros Communications, co-founded by Professors Teresa Meng and John Hennessy in 1998, helped pioneer Wi-Fi (wireless Ethernet) systems by developing the first radio chip in CMOS, enabling mainstream consumer adoption of the technology. Professor Emeritus Arogyaswami Paulraj developed a wireless technology called âmultiple-input multiple-outputâ transmission, which is at the core of current Wi-Fi and 4G mobile wireless (WiMax and LTE) systems.
With faculty and students working on problems ranging from individual chip architectures to the performance modeling and future structure of the Internet, Stanford will remain influential in networking for decades to come.

Revered almost universally as the guide to the most efficient algorithms, Don Knuthâs multivolume set of books The Art of Computer Programming was first published in 1968. In 1999, American Scientist magazine deemed it among the 12 most important physical sciences monographs of the 20th century, and it has been translated into languages as diverse as Polish and Korean.
Volumes 1 and 2 here are second editions. This Volume 3 is a first edition. Knuth continues to expand the scope of the series. Volume 4 covers combinatorial algorithms, and preview fascicles of the text are in circulation. Volume 5 will present syntactic algorithms.
In his 1974 lecture as a recipient of computingâs highest honor, the Association for Computing Machineryâs Turing Award, Knuth explained why he called programming an âartâ rather than âscience,â concluding: âWe have seen that computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do and do it better.â

The greatness of Yahoo! wasnât magic. It was the foresight and hard work of electrical engineering graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo. In 1994, they used these servers, Konishiki and Akebono (motherboard shown below), to find and categorize pages on the nascent World Wide Web. âThousands of people were producing new websites every day,â Filo told the school in 1996. âWe were just trying to take all that stuff and organize it to make it useful.â
The result was a website with categories and subcategories, essentially a directory, of the many sites they found. The companyâs name is consequently an acronym for âYet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.â By autumn 1994, the site run by these servers in a campus trailer handled a million hits a day. With venture funding the next year, Yahoo! began its amazing growth into the major Internet media company it is today with hundreds of millions of users.
With a more than 50-year history of world-class research and teaching in subjects ranging from transistor devices to computer architecture, Stanford Engineering is known for attracting many of the worldâs best faculty members and students in these areas. One result has been the development of some of the worldâs most influential microprocessors by professors and alumni.

Rendering three-dimensional computer graphics requires specialized processing of geometric information. The Geometry Engine chip, developed in the early 1980s mainly by former Professor Jim Clark and student Marc Hannah, was the first realization of such a processor with the modern sophistication of âvery large scale integrationâ (a wafer of these chips is pictured below). In 1981, along with Kurt Akeley, Vern Anderson, David Brown, Tom Davis, Mark Grossman, Herb Kuta, Charles âRockyâ Rhodes and Abbey Silverstone, Clark and Hannah founded the company Silicon Graphics Inc., which came to dominate high-end graphics for years.
In 1969, alumnus Marcian âTedâ Hoff proposed a simple computer architecture as a way to realize calculators for Busicom, a Japanese company. With Intel co-workers Stanley Mazor and Federico Faggin, the design was completed and released in 1971 as the first microprocessor, launching Intel as the worldâs leading processor maker.
MIPS is a full wafer of the processors that popularized the high-performance Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture. It was the brainchild of researchers led by Professor John Hennessy in 1981. 
Alumnus Skip Stritter was the chief architect in 1979 of this influential processor, displayed in its original packaging and in the accompanying enlarged photograph. The 68000 enabled several new product areas including workstations (SUN-1, SGI Iris 1000), the Apple Macintosh, printers (Apple LaserWriter and the HP LaserJet) and the first Palm Pilot. It was also the CPU in some Commodore and Atari personal computers.
In 1999, when Jen-Hsun Huang and NVIDIA introduced the GeForce 256, the worldâs first graphics processing unit (GPU), the new ability to render detailed, interactive 3D imagery drew an enthusiastic following among gamers and graphic artists. GPUs have since advanced with exceptional speed. Their parallel structure, which enables many tasks to be processed simultaneously, has expanded their use beyond graphics to data-intensive areas such as financial analysis, medical imaging and scientific research.
Introduced in 2010, the GeForce GTX 480 has more than 130 times the complexity of the GeForce 256, with 3 billion transistors and 480 processing cores.

Stimmen zum Tod von René Pollesch
Einer ganzen Generation von Künstlern hat er ermöglicht, wieder ans Theater zu glauben: Weggefährtinnen und Freunde nehmen fassungslos Abschied von René Pollesch.
René! Resilein! Ich werde jeden Tag an Dich denken. Jeden Tag wirst Du in meinem Herzen sein. Du warst kein Autor schneller, lustiger, geistreicher Diskursstücke. Das warst Du auch, Du konntest ja gar nicht anders, als zu schreiben und zu schreiben und anderen zu begegnen, voller Neugier, ganz offen. Aber noch viel mehr warst Du der große Poet, den wir haben im Theater. Voller Schmerz und Lust, voller Sehnsucht, voller Träume, voller Desillusionierungen. Ich habe Dich vor Augen, mit Deiner ganzen großen Menschlichkeit habe ich Dich vor Augen. There’s a light that never goes out, Reserl. Ich werde Dich immer lieben. Dein Fabian
Irgendwann waren wir alle weit entfernt vom Tod. René Pollesch, Christoph Schlingensief und ich hockten irgendwo, hatten gute Laune und gründeten eine Drei-Mann-Blaskapelle, oder etwas Ähnliches, ich habe es vergessen. Alle glaubten daran, die Welt ein wenig verändern zu können. Jetzt bin nur ich noch übrig, meine Welt ist nicht wirklich besser geworden, nun hat sie wieder einen Riss mehr, der sich nicht mehr schließen wird.
Gestern Abend das Handy noch mal eingeschaltet, und dann ein echter Schock. Erst hab ich gar nicht realisiert, was ich lese. Ich sah es auf Bild.de: STAR-INTENDANT MIT 61 JAHREN GESTORBEN. Dann musste ich kurz lachen, denn genau das war er ja nicht. Hätte ihm aber vielleicht genau deswegen gefallen. Natürlich kann man keinen Satz über René Pollesch lesen, ohne sofort zu denken, was er dazu gesagt hätte. Vor allem kann ich keinen Text über ihn schreiben, der ihm gerecht würde. Ich habe am Schauspiel Stuttgart in zwei Stücken von ihm mitgespielt: „Wenn die Schauspieler mal einen freien Abend brauchen, übernimmt Hedley Lamarr“ (jawohl, „Hedley“ Lamarr, nicht Hedy) und „Drei Western“. Er hat meine Sicht auf alles verändert. Also, lieber René, vielleicht geht das in Ordnung für Dich, wenn ich von den vielen tollen Sätzen, die ich von Dir gehört habe, hier einen meiner Lieblinge verrate: „Als andere Jungs Fußball spielten, ging ich zur Lilli-Palmer-Lesung.“
René hat mich intellektuell wie organisch tief geprägt. Ich glaube, ich wäre nicht derselbe Mensch, wenn ich ihm nicht begegnet wäre. Sein fundamentales Hinterfragen unseres sozialen, gesellschaftlichen und emotionalen Selbstverständnisses und unserer Lebenseinstellung, René schien das Einzigartige in einem zu lieben, das Unvergleichliche. Wenn man sich getraut hat, aus seinem Käfig auszutreten und einen Gedanken zu packen oder sich physisch sinnlich selbst zu überraschen, dann hat er immer euphorisch und hungrig und genüsslich laut aufgelacht, wie nur er lachen konnte. René hat mir ganz viel Kraft gegeben, mein Verständnis von Liebe, von Beziehungen, von Schmerz ist tief von ihm geprägt. Seine letzte Arbeit mit Fabian Hinrichs ist eines der existenziellsten, dunkelsten Dinge, die ich jemals im Theater gesehen habe. Das hat mich fundamental berührt und mir viel Würde und Hoffnung zurückgegeben und den Glauben an das Theater als allergrößte Kunstform.
Ach. Du hast auf Deine einmalige Weise dem Theater seine Fesseln gesprengt, den Spielern und Spielerinnen eine Freiheit, eine Mündigkeit zurückgegeben, hast mich immer in Mark und Bein erwischt und mich dabei so zärtlichst geküsst, wie nur Du es konntest. Du warst immer so akut in allem, so Gegenwart, so da. Jetzt nicht mehr. Das ist kaum auszuhalten. Kaum zu ertragen. Ach.
Lieber René, ich mag nicht glauben, was passiert ist. Seit ich 2000 das erste Mal mit Dir gearbeitet habe, hat es bis heute in jeder anderen Arbeit eine kleine Stimme in meinem Kopf gegeben, die alle Texte abglich mit dem, was wir in Deinen Stücken sprachen. Die Proben mit Dir waren eine intensive, Zigaretten-lustige Diskussion über alles, was wir sehen, lesen und erleben. Von Dir kommt der Satz „Denke von deinen alltäglichen Verrichtungen her“ in meine Arbeit. Von Dir habe ich die Gewissheit, dass Schauspieler eine Autorenschaft ausüben auf der Bühne. Dass die Frage nach der Urheberschaft am Theater immer nur das Gemeinschaftliche als Antwort kennt. Wie man nun überall lesen und hören kann. Der Konsens, den Du so verachtet hast, schließt Dich jetzt mit ein. Die Revolution frisst keine Kinder, sie frisst die Eltern. Ich vermisse Dich unendlich und bin todtraurig, um Dich, um uns, um alles, wofür Du laut warst. Laut und hedonistisch.
Ohne René wäre meine Generation sehr arm, orientierungslos und starr geworden. Er hat durch seine gemeinschaftsstiftende Art ein Theater als Erfahrungs- und Gemeinschaftsort erfunden, das sämtliche Konventionen sprengte. Die Art, wie die Menschen auf der Bühne mit dem Publikum in einen Dialog getreten sind, über die Texte und Sprache neue Denk- und Erfahrungsräume geschaffen haben, hat das deutschsprachige Theater und weit darüber hinaus geprägt und verändert. Plötzlich entstanden Möglichkeiten, die zuvor undenkbar waren. Die Leichtigkeit, Schlagfertigkeit, die Selbstironie hatten einen enormen Einfluss auf meine Jugend und auf die Arbeit, die wir alle heute praktizieren. René hat uns eine sehr lange Jugend ermöglicht. Jetzt scheint diese Jugend vorbei zu sein. Sein Tod markiert für mich und viele meiner Generation eine Zäsur. René hat mit Bert Neumann und vielen anderen ein neues Theater erfunden. Man wollte Teil davon sein und darin weiterdenken. Ein so lebendiges Theater, dass kein Tod der Welt es jemals aufhalten kann. Wir werden es weiterleben und -erleben, für ihn, für uns, für uns gemeinsam. Danke!
Manche brachten Subjekte direkt aufs Theater, andere erkannten von einer externen Perspektive, dass denen Regeln und Strukturen zugrunde liegen. Dann ließ man diese Wahrheiten von heroischen Besserwissern verkörpern oder als Ergebnis tragischer Konflikte oder gesellschaftlicher Ursachen Bühnen bevölkern. Nur einer hat es geschafft, die Strukturen selbst auf die Bühne zu bringen: ohne höhere Ebene, ohne Verkörperung, sondern als das, was sich aus Vorgaben aller Art von selbst ergibt. Dessen Form folgte notwendig dem prinzipiellen Slapstick des Geistes in einer Welt, die ihm über den Kopf wächst. Dieser Slapstick ist keine Disziplin der Darstellung, kein Genre – eher ein Rhythmus, ein Beat, im neoliberalen patriarchalen Kapitalismus kann er besonders laut oder funky werden. Menschen sind keine Maschinen, aber auch nicht souverän, tragisch oder tief. Ihren legitimen Protest äußern sie intellektuell ausrutschend und nervensägenhaft repetitiv – aber auf hohem Niveau. Am besten als Band, Quartett, kleine Gang oder Chor. Heute wissen wir das, wir können mit diesem humanen Antihumanismus arbeiten. Vor René Pollesch gab es das nicht.
Ich habe René am engsten 2018 und 2019 bei der Vorarbeit und den Proben zu „Glauben an die Möglichkeit der völligen Erneuerung der Welt“ kennengelernt. Es war für viele in der Theaterwelt die überraschendste Bühnenkooperation der Theatersaison 2019/20: Der damals noch designierte Volksbühnen-Intendant wagt sich an die größte Showbühne der Welt, die Fabian Hinrichs mit 27 unserer Tänzerinnen und Tänzer virtuos bespielte. René liebte das Genre der Revue, er hat sich, oft umgeben von seinen Kreativen, unsere Grand Shows angesehen. Aber natürlich war das Pollesch-Hinrichs-Stück dann alles andere als der Abklatsch einer Revue, es war ein purer Pollesch-Abend.
Für mich, aber auch für den ganzen Palast, war es eine völlig ungewohnte Art des Arbeitens. Bei unseren Grand Shows wissen wir schon ein Jahr vorher, wie der Aufbau ist, wie welche Szenen aussehen und wie das Finale aussieht. Mir schien, beide wussten am Vortag der Premiere noch nicht genau, vielleicht noch nicht mal am Morgen der Premiere, wie das Stück enden soll. Aber natürlich, wie immer, fanden sie den Bogen – und es wurde ein Triumph, auch die Medien überschlugen sich. Jede Vorstellung war ausverkauft (und in den Palast passen 1900 Menschen).
René war vieles und manchmal auch das Gegenteil, nur gemein war er nicht, und zwar niemals. Ein nahbarer Intellektueller, ein zugewandter, lächelnder Mensch. Selbstsicher unsicher, zweifelnd, aber nicht verzweifelt. Er war nicht eitel, keine Diva, aber er wusste, wer er ist und was er will, und einfach war er auch nicht. Aber auch nicht kompliziert. Er nahm sich nicht wichtig, wusste aber, dass er es war. Er war umgeben von Menschen, Menschen, die ihn liebten, aber er hatte, fand ich, auch eine Aura der Einsamkeit, eines Alleinseins unter Menschen, das ihn womöglich nicht traurig gemacht hat, sondern das er suchte. Er hatte so viel zu sagen, aber das tat er nicht über Gebühr, im Gegenteil, er hörte zu, fragte, interessierte sich, war einfühlsam. War er glücklich? Ich weiß es nicht, aber womöglich war er auch nicht unglücklich. Und das ist schon viel, wenn man mit so einem scharfen Verstand gesegnet (oder gestraft) ist, alles sieht – und nicht daran verzweifelt, sondern lächelt, nicht aufgesetzt, und weitermacht und Freude daran findet.
Es brauchte wohl diese scheinbaren, friedlich nebeneinanderher lebenden Widersprüche, um diese crazy Welt in immer auch liebevolle Theaterstücke zu gießen. Klug die Abgründe und Zumutungen des Lebens auszuleuchten, ernsthaft und empathisch, nicht spöttisch, und das auf eine denkbar witzige Weise, wie viel größer kann ein Widerspruch sein? Lachend an der Welt verzweifeln, und um das ins Bild zu setzen, brauchte und fand und band er kongeniale Partner, Schauspielerinnen und Schauspieler an sich, wie eben auch Fabian Hinrichs.
Nun lässt er uns allein und abgesehen von den aktuell noch laufenden Stücken wird es wohl keinen authentischen Pollesch-Abend mehr geben. Neuaufnahmen? Ohne Pollesch für mich eigentlich undenkbar. Aber auch wenn seine Stücke nun vielleicht sterben, er wird es in einem immateriellen Sinne nicht.
Ich bin geschockt. Als René 2003 seine Stücke im Volksbühnen-Prater inszenierte, habe ich überhaupt erst angefangen ins Theater zu gehen. Vorher war Theater für mich meistens langweilig und prätentiös. Pollesch-Stücke haben Spaß gemacht, sie waren lustig und gleichzeitig überfordernd mit toller Musik und nie zuvor gehörten elliptischen Theorie-Satz-Kaskaden. Als ich mit meiner Band Britta die Musik für seine Serie „24 Stunden sind kein Tag“ gespielt habe, wurde mir auch klar, was für ein außergewöhnlicher Regisseur und Mensch er war. Ich glaube, alle auf und hinter der Bühne haben ihn sehr geliebt. Wenn man ihn in der Volksbühne getroffen hat, war er auch als Intendant unglaublich liebenswürdig und interessiert. Er war einfach ein so guter Typ, und es tut so weh, dass er nicht mehr da ist. Er war eine Ausnahmeerscheinung erst recht im Vergleich zu den anderen aufgeblasenen Intendanten, die sonst so an den Bühnen sind. Berlin wird ohne ihn nicht mehr dieselbe Stadt sein. Ich bin sehr traurig.
Es war vor einem Jahr im April, wir hatten gerade zur Einweihung von Raphaela Vogels Skulptur auf dem Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz ein Lied aufgeführt und saßen danach, wie man es so tut, in kleiner Runde in der Kantine der Volksbühne. Es war ein Samstag, früher Abend, die Kantine, sonst vollgestopft mit Schauspielern und Angehörigen und Technikern und Fleißigen und faulen Hinzugeschleppten, war fast leer. In einer Ecke, so meine ich mich zu erinnern, saßen ein paar Techniker. An einem Tisch nicht weit von uns saßen, hockten zwei oder drei Schauspielerinnen mit einem Laptop, die irgendetwas planten. Ab und zu gab es Durchsagen, und die Leute verließen die Kantine, um zu arbeiten. Wir aßen Würstchen, glaube ich, aber Würstchen fühlen sich in der Kantine der Volksbühne natürlich ganz anders an, es waren quasi Ehrenwürstchen, Künstlerischer-Underground-Würstchen. Vielleicht war es auch Gulasch.
Plötzlich gab es Streit. Ein freundlicher schlanker Herr, der an unserem Tisch saß, hatte einem anderen Tischgenossen ein Video zeigen wollen, worauf die Schauspielerin vom Nebentisch aufsprang, zum Tisch stürzte, und sagte, sie arbeiteten an etwas, wir sollen gefälligst leise sein. Nun war es Samstagabend, leerer als gewöhnlich, aber doch Samstagabend, aber wir verstanden, natürlich, entschuldigten uns, sie ging zurück zu ihrem Laptop, das Video wurde leiser gedreht. Zeigen wollte der Herr es dennoch, die Schauspielerin sprang wieder auf, fuhr uns an, leise zu sein, wobei sie uns regelrecht anspuckte. Einer von uns war peinlich berührt und ging. Wir diskutierten, es war inzwischen halb neun, ob wir im Unrecht waren, aber es war doch Samstagabend!
Dann kam der Hausmeister. Oder Kantinenchef, ich war mir nicht sicher. Er erkannte ein paar am Tisch und setzte sich kurz zu uns, ich sagte ihm, er müsse aber leise sein. Wegen der Konzentration. Er fragte, wer das behauptet hätte, dass man jetzt leise sein müsse, an einem Samstagabend, wir wollten nicht petzen. Eine Durchsage kam, der Hausmeister musste weiter. Aber auf dem Weg nach draußen ging er zum Nebentisch und verteidigte uns. Die Kantine, sagte er den Laptop-Damen, sei ein Ort des Miteinanders. Es gäbe andere frei verfügbare Räume für Laptop-Arbeit, die er ihnen gerne aufschließen könne, aber hier sollten Gäste willkommen sein und sich wohlfühlen, hier sollte Austausch stattfinden. Denn nur so (aber vielleicht habe ich mir den folgenden Satz in den Monaten danach dazu gedacht) bliebe der Ort lebendig. Dann ging er wieder an seine Arbeit.
Das war aber nett von dem Hausmeister, sagte ich den anderen am Tisch. Sie lachten mich aus. Und eröffneten mir: Der Hausmeister war René Pollesch.
Ich habe mich sofort gefragt, was passiert nun mit der Volksbühne? Mir fiel Heiner Müller ein, der nach der Wende gesagt hat, man sollte die Theater jetzt alle mal schließen, um zu sehen, ob sie noch gebraucht werden. Man kann nach Renés Tod nicht einfach zur Tagesordnung übergehen. Die Lücke muss möglichst lange sichtbar bleiben, um zu verstehen, was für ein Verlust sein Tod ist. Er war für mich ein großes Vorbild. Ich habe an der Volksbühne erst relativ spät, 2016, mit Pollesch gearbeitet.
Wir haben drei Stücke zusammen gemacht, gemeinsam mit Martin Wuttke und Trystan Pütter. Da habe ich erlebt, was es bedeutet, in einer Art Autorenschaft an so einem Prozess beteiligt zu sein. René war einer, der einem den Blick und die Gedanken geschärft hat. Wir haben nicht nur ein Stück reproduziert, Figuren gespielt, sondern wir haben uns mit Gedanken, mit Inhalten beschäftigt und uns darüber ausgetauscht. Dadurch wussten wir auf der Bühne immer, worüber wir reden. Das, was ich auf der Bühne gesagt habe, habe ich nicht als Dienstleister für den Autor oder Regisseur gesagt, sondern das wollte ich auch sagen. Das Stück entstand aus unseren Gesprächen, aus dem gemeinsamen Austausch und dem Ausprobieren der Dialoge, es war fertig am Tag der Premiere.
Ich hatte eine Freiheit beim Spielen, wie ich sie noch nie erlebt habe. Das ist das größte Geschenk, das man einem Schauspieler machen kann. Ich habe das als absolutes Glück erfahren. Das hat auch meine eigene Arbeit als Regisseur sehr beeinflusst, indem ich in den Dialog mit Schauspielern trete und versuche, ein Stück nicht einfach nur abzulatschen, sondern gemeinsam an Vorschlägen zu arbeiten. Man muss solche Erfahrungen weitergeben. René war ein wahnsinnig warmherziger, neugieriger und freundlicher Mensch, der jedem zugehört hat. Ein Mensch ganz ohne Dünkel. Er hat sich auch nichts darauf eingebildet, wer er ist und was er tut. Es war für ihn eine Notwendigkeit. Ich weiß noch gar nicht, wie sehr ich ihn vermisse und wie er uns allen fehlen wird. Die Liebe zu ihm wird nicht kleiner werden, sondern größer.
Eines der ersten Theaterbilder, die ich nicht mehr aus dem Kopf bekam, war der sterbende Molière in Ariane Mnouchkines Film über den französischen Dramatiker. Wie er endlos blutspuckend die Treppe hinuntergetragen wurde. René wurde vielleicht der deutsche Molière, kleidungsmäßig stilisierte er sich zum Brecht des neuen Jahrhunderts. Er lebte mit seiner Clique von Schauspielerinnen und Schauspielern zusammen. Er rannte gern mit ihnen in die Notaufnahmen der Krankenhäuser oder Psychiatrien, wartete dort auch mal sieben Stunden, wenn es nur seiner Familie gut ging. Kaum war er am Probieren mit ihnen, ging es darum, genug Zeit zum Schreiben zu haben. Er reflektierte das Internetzeitalter als Erster in Form der von ihm hervorgerufenen Hysterie, wenn schon nicht mehr direkt geredet wird. Es machte Spaß, Zeit mit ihm zu verbringen. Meist auf dem Innenhof der Kammerspiele. Schade, dass wir in ihm nicht unseren Komödienautor entdeckt haben, der Boulevard und Intellektualität in einer neuen Form verband. Ich hoffe, wir entdecken seine Texte neu und finden eine Möglichkeit, sie neu zu spielen. Und ich sehe ihn jetzt im barocken Theater in Paris interessiert auf uns herunterblicken.
Es ist unfassbar, wie jung René Pollesch von uns gegangen ist. Er war nicht nur für mich, sondern für eine ganze Generation ein wichtiger Künstler des Theaters. Ohne Polleschs Inszenierungen hätte ich mich niemals in das deutsche Theatersystem getraut. Seine Arbeiten haben uns gezeigt, wie Theater auch sein kann und wie neue spielerische Formen gehen. „Ping Pong D’Amour“ an den Münchner Kammerspielen habe ich 2009 mindestens siebenmal angeschaut. Er war eine Inspiration für uns alle. Ruhe in Frieden.
René! Resilein! Ich werde jeden Tag an Dich denken. Jeden Tag wirst Du in meinem Herzen sein. Du warst kein Autor schneller, lustiger, geistreicher Diskursstücke. Das warst Du auch, Du konntest ja gar nicht anders, als zu schreiben und zu schreiben und anderen zu begegnen, voller Neugier, ganz offen.

Mir schien, beide wussten am Vortag der Premiere noch nicht genau, vielleicht noch nicht mal am Morgen der Premiere, wie das Stück enden soll. Aber natürlich, wie immer, fanden sie den Bogen – und es wurde ein Triumph, auch die Medien überschlugen sich. Jede Vorstellung war ausverkauft (und in den Palast passen 1900 Menschen).
René war vieles und manchmal auch das Gegenteil, nur gemein war er nicht, und zwar niemals. Ein nahbarer Intellektueller, ein zugewandter, lächelnder Mensch. Selbstsicher unsicher, zweifelnd, aber nicht verzweifelt. Er war nicht eitel, keine Diva, aber er wusste, wer er ist und was er will, und einfach war er auch nicht. Aber auch nicht kompliziert. Er nahm sich nicht wichtig, wusste aber, dass er es war. Er war umgeben von Menschen, Menschen, die ihn liebten, aber er hatte, fand ich, auch eine Aura der Einsamkeit, eines Alleinseins unter Menschen, das ihn womöglich nicht traurig gemacht hat, sondern das er suchte. Er hatte so viel zu sagen, aber das tat er nicht über Gebühr, im Gegenteil, er hörte zu, fragte, interessierte sich, war einfühlsam. War er glücklich? Ich weiß es nicht, aber womöglich war er auch nicht unglücklich. Und das ist schon viel, wenn man mit so einem scharfen Verstand gesegnet (oder gestraft) ist, alles sieht – und nicht daran verzweifelt, sondern lächelt, nicht aufgesetzt, und weitermacht und Freude daran findet.
Es brauchte wohl diese scheinbaren, friedlich nebeneinanderher lebenden Widersprüche, um diese crazy Welt in immer auch liebevolle Theaterstücke zu gießen. Klug die Abgründe und Zumutungen des Lebens auszuleuchten, ernsthaft und empathisch, nicht spöttisch, und das auf eine denkbar witzige Weise, wie viel größer kann ein Widerspruch sein? Lachend an der Welt verzweifeln, und um das ins Bild zu setzen, brauchte und fand und band er kongeniale Partner, Schauspielerinnen und Schauspieler an sich, wie eben auch Fabian Hinrichs.
Nun lässt er uns allein und abgesehen von den aktuell noch laufenden Stücken wird es wohl keinen authentischen Pollesch-Abend mehr geben. Neuaufnahmen? Ohne Pollesch für mich eigentlich undenkbar. Aber auch wenn seine Stücke nun vielleicht sterben, er wird es in einem immateriellen Sinne nicht.
Ich bin geschockt. Als René 2003 seine Stücke im Volksbühnen-Prater inszenierte, habe ich überhaupt erst angefangen ins Theater zu gehen. Vorher war Theater für mich meistens langweilig und prätentiös. Pollesch-Stücke haben Spaß gemacht, sie waren lustig und gleichzeitig überfordernd mit toller Musik und nie zuvor gehörten elliptischen Theorie-Satz-Kaskaden. Als ich mit meiner Band Britta die Musik für seine Serie „24 Stunden sind kein Tag“ gespielt habe, wurde mir auch klar, was für ein außergewöhnlicher Regisseur und Mensch er war. Ich glaube, alle auf und hinter der Bühne haben ihn sehr geliebt. Wenn man ihn in der Volksbühne getroffen hat, war er auch als Intendant unglaublich liebenswürdig und interessiert. Er war einfach ein so guter Typ, und es tut so weh, dass er nicht mehr da ist. Er war eine Ausnahmeerscheinung erst recht im Vergleich zu den anderen aufgeblasenen Intendanten, die sonst so an den Bühnen sind. Berlin wird ohne ihn nicht mehr dieselbe Stadt sein. Ich bin sehr traurig.
Es war vor einem Jahr im April, wir hatten gerade zur Einweihung von Raphaela Vogels Skulptur auf dem Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz ein Lied aufgeführt und saßen danach, wie man es so tut, in kleiner Runde in der Kantine der Volksbühne. Es war ein Samstag, früher Abend, die Kantine, sonst vollgestopft mit Schauspielern und Angehörigen und Technikern und Fleißigen und faulen Hinzugeschleppten, war fast leer. In einer Ecke, so meine ich mich zu erinnern, saßen ein paar Techniker. An einem Tisch nicht weit von uns saßen, hockten zwei oder drei Schauspielerinnen mit einem Laptop, die irgendetwas planten. Ab und zu gab es Durchsagen, und die Leute verließen die Kantine, um zu arbeiten. Wir aßen Würstchen, glaube ich, aber Würstchen fühlen sich in der Kantine der Volksbühne natürlich ganz anders an, es waren quasi Ehrenwürstchen, Künstlerischer-Underground-Würstchen. Vielleicht war es auch Gulasch.
Plötzlich gab es Streit. Ein freundlicher schlanker Herr, der an unserem Tisch saß, hatte einem anderen Tischgenossen ein Video zeigen wollen, worauf die Schauspielerin vom Nebentisch aufsprang, zum Tisch stürzte, und sagte, sie arbeiteten an etwas, wir sollen gefälligst leise sein. Nun war es Samstagabend, leerer als gewöhnlich, aber doch Samstagabend, aber wir verstanden, natürlich, entschuldigten uns, sie ging zurück zu ihrem Laptop, das Video wurde leiser gedreht. Zeigen wollte der Herr es dennoch, die Schauspielerin sprang wieder auf, fuhr uns an, leise zu sein, wobei sie uns regelrecht anspuckte. Einer von uns war peinlich berührt und ging. Wir diskutierten, es war inzwischen halb neun, ob wir im Unrecht waren, aber es war doch Samstagabend!
Dann kam der Hausmeister. Oder Kantinenchef, ich war mir nicht sicher. Er erkannte ein paar am Tisch und setzte sich kurz zu uns, ich sagte ihm, er müsse aber leise sein. Wegen der Konzentration. Er fragte, wer das behauptet hätte, dass man jetzt leise sein müsse, an einem Samstagabend, wir wollten nicht petzen. Eine Durchsage kam, der Hausmeister musste weiter. Aber auf dem Weg nach draußen ging er zum Nebentisch und verteidigte uns. Die Kantine, sagte er den Laptop-Damen, sei ein Ort des Miteinanders. Es gäbe andere frei verfügbare Räume für Laptop-Arbeit, die er ihnen gerne aufschließen könne, aber hier sollten Gäste willkommen sein und sich wohlfühlen, hier sollte Austausch stattfinden. Denn nur so (aber vielleicht habe ich mir den folgenden Satz in den Monaten danach dazu gedacht) bliebe der Ort lebendig. Dann ging er wieder an seine Arbeit.
Das war aber nett von dem Hausmeister, sagte ich den anderen am Tisch. Sie lachten mich aus. Und eröffneten mir: Der Hausmeister war René Pollesch.
Ich habe mich sofort gefragt, was passiert nun mit der Volksbühne? Mir fiel Heiner Müller ein, der nach der Wende gesagt hat, man sollte die Theater jetzt alle mal schließen, um zu sehen, ob sie noch gebraucht werden. Man kann nach Renés Tod nicht einfach zur Tagesordnung übergehen. Die Lücke muss möglichst lange sichtbar bleiben, um zu verstehen, was für ein Verlust sein Tod ist. Er war für mich ein großes Vorbild. Ich habe an der Volksbühne erst relativ spät, 2016, mit Pollesch gearbeitet.
Wir haben drei Stücke zusammen gemacht, gemeinsam mit Martin Wuttke und Trystan Pütter. Da habe ich erlebt, was es bedeutet, in einer Art Autorenschaft an so einem Prozess beteiligt zu sein. René war einer, der einem den Blick und die Gedanken geschärft hat. Wir haben nicht nur ein Stück reproduziert, Figuren gespielt, sondern wir haben uns mit Gedanken, mit Inhalten beschäftigt und uns darüber ausgetauscht. Dadurch wussten wir auf der Bühne immer, worüber wir reden. Das, was ich auf der Bühne gesagt habe, habe ich nicht als Dienstleister für den Autor oder Regisseur gesagt, sondern das wollte ich auch sagen. Das Stück entstand aus unseren Gesprächen, aus dem gemeinsamen Austausch und dem Ausprobieren der Dialoge, es war fertig am Tag der Premiere.
Ich hatte eine Freiheit beim Spielen, wie ich sie noch nie erlebt habe. Das ist das größte Geschenk, das man einem Schauspieler machen kann. Ich habe das als absolutes Glück erfahren. Das hat auch meine eigene Arbeit als Regisseur sehr beeinflusst, indem ich in den Dialog mit Schauspielern trete und versuche, ein Stück nicht einfach nur abzulatschen, sondern gemeinsam an Vorschlägen zu arbeiten. Man muss solche Erfahrungen weitergeben. René war ein wahnsinnig warmherziger, neugieriger und freundlicher Mensch, der jedem zugehört hat. Ein Mensch ganz ohne Dünkel. Er hat sich auch nichts darauf eingebildet, wer er ist und was er tut. Es war für ihn eine Notwendigkeit. Ich weiß noch gar nicht, wie sehr ich ihn vermisse und wie er uns allen fehlen wird. Die Liebe zu ihm wird nicht kleiner werden, sondern größer.
Eines der ersten Theaterbilder, die ich nicht mehr aus dem Kopf bekam, war der sterbende Molière in Ariane Mnouchkines Film über den französischen Dramatiker. Wie er endlos blutspuckend die Treppe hinuntergetragen wurde. René wurde vielleicht der deutsche Molière, kleidungsmäßig stilisierte er sich zum Brecht des neuen Jahrhunderts. Er lebte mit seiner Clique von Schauspielerinnen und Schauspielern zusammen. Er rannte gern mit ihnen in die Notaufnahmen der Krankenhäuser oder Psychiatrien, wartete dort auch mal sieben Stunden, wenn es nur seiner Familie gut ging. Kaum war er am Probieren mit ihnen, ging es darum, genug Zeit zum Schreiben zu haben. Er reflektierte das Internetzeitalter als Erster in Form der von ihm hervorgerufenen Hysterie, wenn schon nicht mehr direkt geredet wird. Es machte Spaß, Zeit mit ihm zu verbringen. Meist auf dem Innenhof der Kammerspiele. Schade, dass wir in ihm nicht unseren Komödienautor entdeckt haben, der Boulevard und Intellektualität in einer neuen Form verband. Ich hoffe, wir entdecken seine Texte neu und finden eine Möglichkeit, sie neu zu spielen. Und ich sehe ihn jetzt im barocken Theater in Paris interessiert auf uns herunterblicken.
Es ist unfassbar, wie jung René Pollesch von uns gegangen ist. Er war nicht nur für mich, sondern für eine ganze Generation ein wichtiger Künstler des Theaters. Ohne Polleschs Inszenierungen hätte ich mich niemals in das deutsche Theatersystem getraut. Seine Arbeiten haben uns gezeigt, wie Theater auch sein kann und wie neue spielerische Formen gehen. „Ping Pong D’Amour“ an den Münchner Kammerspielen habe ich 2009 mindestens siebenmal angeschaut. Er war eine Inspiration für uns alle. Ruhe in Frieden.

Drupalâs Layout Builder feature has established a critical content creation and display framework in the four years since its integration into Core. Replacing older, more complex tools like Panels and Display Suite, this integration marked a significant shift towards a more user-friendly, native layout-building experience. Better yet, unlike other JavaScript-based content layout tools, LayoutBuilder retains support for Drupalâs more powerful features like views, accessibility, and multilingual, to name just a few.
Despite its robustness, creating an excellent Layout Builder experience for your content editors typically requires several additional community modules. These modules add layout options, style customizations, granular permissions, content preview-ability, and, most importantly, fewer clicks to get the job done! You can see a list of Additional Modules for Layout Builder on Drupal.org.  Knowing which ones to choose and how best to configure them is a challenge of its own.
To help solve some of these friction-ridden experiences, Tag1 would like to formally introduce its new Layout Builder Plus Module, which dramatically helps improve Drupalâs content editor experience out of the box!

After working with several Fortune 500 clients to customize and build compelling site builder experiences using Layout Builder in Drupal Core, Tag1 has turned this work into a community module with the efforts of Tim Bozeman as the projectâs lead developer and maintainer. You can watch a quick demo of the module in action here. Additionally, you can find instructions here if you would like to use this with the Umami demo.
Layout Builder Plus  introduces a more intuitive user interface (UI), helping better show the content rendered on the page, adding default block icons, and the ability to drag and drop from a searchable block list, to name a few features. It also provides immediate visual reference and feedback for the content creator, reducing the typical five clicks to get a block into a layout down to just one drag-and-drop event!
Additionally, the new âPromoted Blocksâ feature is crucial in streamlining content placement by making a curated list of commonly used blocks more readily available to just drop on the page.  No more searching for that newsletter signup form block!
Another critical aspect of Layout Builder Plus is the inclusion of the much-needed, sortable sections. This functionality allows users to easily organize and manage larger content sections, offering greater flexibility in content arrangement, whereas previously, this was a somewhat painful experience.
Layout Builder Plus also introduces the powerful Nested Layouts feature. This feature allows a content editor to place and organize blocks in a reusable, nested layout that can be moved around the parent layout, where you can duplicate and save it for placement on other pages with section_library! This feature alone will be a huge time saver for Site Builders managing lots of content pages moving forward.

Lastly, the block duplication feature in Layout Builder Plus again increases efficiency by allowing users to replicate blocks quickly with placeholder content. The module's cleaner user interface mirrors the published content, making the editing process more intuitive and user-friendly.
Tag1 is not done building Layout Builder Plus; we are just getting started and will continue to improve on the interface and add intuitive features in hopes that we make it as easy as possible for Site Builders to gain the most out of the Layout Builder experience in Drupal.
At Tag1, we have a long history of driving innovation with Drupal and strongly believe in enhancing the platform for everyone to use by not building proprietary add-ons. We know that this makes Drupal great and drives the adoption of our favorite CMS.
Layout Builder Plus is a generous step in the right direction, and we welcome you to use and contribute to its development by reporting issues and identifying desired improvements or, even better, submitting a pull request! (or two!)
Drupal's Layout Builder has revolutionized content editing, and at Tag1, we're here to take it a step further. Our experts are ready to enhance your Drupal experience, blending our deep open-source knowledge with innovative solutions like Layout Builder Plus.
Ready for an outstanding content management system? Contact Tag1 to learn more about how we can help you make amazing content experiences Let's work together to craft a solution that's efficient, exceptional, and ideally suited to your unique needs.

  become an invaluable ally for those on the front lines of truth-seeking and
  progressive political advocacy:
Investigative journalists have used Tails to securely unearth

    journalists from PODER and Serendipia used Tails to investigate the
    systematic espionage of feminists and LGBTQIA+ groups by the Mexican
    army.
Activists have used Tails to organize and communicate with
    each other, even in repressive regimes. For example, reproductive rights
    activists in Brazil have used Tails to protect their work and personal data
    from intrusive law enforcement and boyfriends alike.
Whistleblowers have used Tails to expose wrongdoing without
    compromising their identities or endangering their sources. For example,
    Edward Snowden and his collaborators used Tails to expose the massive
    global surveillance programs orchestrated by the NSA and the Five Eyes
    intelligence alliance.
Tails is non-profit, and runs on a relatively small budget. We have
  punched above our weight thanks to your support, and we continue to need your

Tails is an endless work of updates and maintenance: publishing a
        new release every 4 weeks to fix security vulnerabilities, adapting to
        new versions of the underlying software, keeping our website and
        development infrastructure secure and reliable, etc.
In 2022, we restructured the installation instructions, fixed many
        usability issues in the Tor Connection assistant, and redesigned
        the Persistent Storage.
Even the most secure software is worthless if the people who need it
        cannot use it. We work hard to understand our users, make it easy to
        use Tails, and help them make informed security decisions.
We make the most of the money that we receive because we prefer spending
        our time improving Tails for our users.
If you look at the way post-2013 whistleblowers have been caught,
it is clear the absolute most important thing you can do to maintain
your anonymity is reduce the number of places in your operational
activity where you can make mistakes. Tor and Tails still do precisely
that.
Tails expands Tor's protections to an entire operating system, and
they do so with an unwavering commitment to their Social Contract. Tails
is a favorite companion tool of Tor.
One of the most robust ways of using the Tor network is through a
dedicated operating system that enforces strong privacy- and
security-protective defaults. That operating system is Tails.

	The scrypt key derivation function was originally developed
	for use in the Tarsnap online
	backup system and is designed to be far more secure against
	hardware brute-force attacks than alternative functions such as
	PBKDF2 or
	bcrypt.
      

	We estimate that on modern (2009) hardware, if 5 seconds are spent
	computing a derived key, the cost of a hardware brute-force attack
	against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost
	of a similar attack against bcrypt (to find the same password), and
	20000 times greater than a similar attack against PBKDF2.
      

	Details of the scrypt key derivation function are given in:
      

	Some additional articles may be of interest:
      

	A simple password-based encryption utility is available as a
	demonstration of the scrypt key derivation function.  On
	modern hardware and with default parameters, the cost of cracking the
	password on a file encrypted by scrypt enc is approximately
	100 billion times more than the cost of cracking the same password on
	a file encrypted by openssl enc; this means that a
	five-character password using scrypt is stronger than a
	ten-character password using openssl.
      

	The scrypt utility can be invoked as scrypt enc infile
	[outfile] to encrypt data (if outfile is not
	specified, the encrypted data is written to the standard output), or
	as scrypt dec infile [outfile] to decrypt data (if
	outfile is not specified, the decrypted data is written to
	the standard output).  scrypt also supports three
	command-line options:
      

	If the encrypted data is corrupt, scrypt dec will exit with
	a non-zero status.  However, scrypt dec may produce
	output before it determines that the encrypted data was corrupt,
	so for applications which require data to be authenticated, you must
	store the output of scrypt dec in a temporary location and
	check scrypt's exit code before using the decrypted data.
      

	To use scrypt as a
	
	  key derivation function (KDF) with libscrypt-kdf,
	  include scrypt-kdf.h and use:
      

	If you would rather copy our source files directly
	into your project, then take a look at the
	lib/crypto/crypto_scrypt.h
	header, which provides crypto_scrypt().
      

	Development of scrypt takes place in the
	scrypt
	git repository.
      

	The scrypt key derivation function and the scrypt
	encryption utility are discussed on the
	scrypt@tarsnap.com mailing list.
      

	The scrypt utility has been tested on FreeBSD, NetBSD,
	OpenBSD, Linux (Slackware, CentOS, Gentoo, Ubuntu), Solaris, OS X,
	Cygwin, and GNU Hurd.  To build scrypt, extract the tarball
	and run ./configure && make.

                                    Xabi Alonso's preference between Liverpool and Bayern Munich has been revealed                                
TEAMtalk can exclusively reveal that Liverpool have offered Xabi Alonso a three-year contract as they aim to beat Bayern Munich to the manager’s signature.
The Merseyside giants have drawn up a shortlist of potential replacements for Jurgen Klopp but Alonso has always been their number one preference.
The Bayer Leverkusen boss is considered to be one of the best young coaches in the world and already has a connection with Liverpool thanks to his time spent there as a player.
Leverkusen currently sit top of the Bundesliga table, eight points clear of Bayern Munich and are on track to lift their first-ever title. The German club have finished as runners-up five times but have never lifted the trophy.
Bayern Munich have been extremely impressed with Alonso’s managerial skills displayed at Leverkusen and with Thomas Tuchel set to leave at the end of the season, they have also made him a top managerial target.
However, TEAMtalk can exclusively reveal that Alonso’s preference is to join Liverpool over the reigning German champions.

TEAMtalk sources have confirmed that positive talks between Liverpool and Alonso’s camp have already taken place.
Liverpool have offered Alonso a three-year contract. If an agreement is reached, any official announcement will be delayed until Klopp has left Anfield.
Alonso has loved his time with Leverkusen but sees the Liverpool job as too big an opportunity to turn down, and believes he has what it takes to replace Klopp.
The coach likes the idea of managing a top Premier League side like Liverpool. He also doesn’t see Bayern Munich as much of a step forward given he is already in a position to dominate the Bundesliga with Leverkusen.
Alonso already has some plans for Liverpool in terms of transfers, too, and would look to bring Leverkusen attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz and right-back Jeremie Frimpong with him to Anfield.
Nothing is done until Alonso signs on the dotted line, however, and Bayern will keep doing everything they can to convince Alonso to join them over the Reds.

                        Chelsea and some of the biggest clubs in Europe have been told to 'watch out' for Man Utd in the race to sign a hugely talented star                    

                        Xabi Alonso is the hot favourite to take over at Liverpool next season, but how does his Bundesliga record compare with Jurgen Klopp's?                    

                        The Reds have been told why their hopes of landing Alonso may already be over, with a top new candidate set to emerge as Liverpool's new top pick to become Klopp's heir                    

                        Kane could re-join Spurs after just a single season at Bayern Munich, with a report detailing the player's willingness to return for two potential reasons

If, for whatever reason, you need to cover your tracks while you are browsing the web on your desktop, you have plenty of options to keep anonymous. Thanks to Orbot, Android users, too, have the option to use the Tor network to anonymize their web browsing sessions and avoid being monitored. Now, thanks to Onion Browser ($0.99), iPhone and iPad users also finally get an easy option to tunnel their web traffic through the Tor network.
The Tor network, in its most basic form, builds a circuit of encrypted connections between a number of nodes on its network. This – at least in theory – makes it very hard to retrace where the original request came from. When you use this network, your data obviously has to travel a lot further and over potentially slower connections than if you were using the regular Internet. Because of this, an app like Onion Browser is also significantly slower in fetching websites than Safari, for example, would be.
As a browser, Onion Browser isn’t exactly packed with features. There are no bookmarks or easy access to search, for example. You do, however, get the option to allow or block cookies, enable user agent spoofing so you can pretend to be using a Windows machine instead of iOS, and the ability to request a new IP address at any time.
One nice aspect of this app is that it is open source. For those who are really paranoid about being anonymous on the Web (and some people obviously have very good reasons to be so), having access to the code means that they can inspect the code to ensure that the app really does what it says it does and then build their own version of the browser.

There's been an increase in Turkey VPN daily usage since May 12
As the final battle for the Turkish presidency is getting closer, experts say Turks are on high alert for potential censorship and internet shutdowns.
Popular VPN service Proton VPN first registered a spike in sign-ups ahead of the first round of elections. The provider told TechRadar that the daily usage of its Turkey VPN has continued to soar.
This climate certainly doesn't come as a surprise considering that current President Erdoğan is infamous for its strict grip on the internet, especially during times of political crisis. Here's what's at stake for people in Turkey in the next few days. 
"Turkey’s history of internet shutdowns, coupled with the recent restrictions on social media, highlights the concerning trend of suppressing information during political unrest. This raises alarm over the possibility of further internet restrictions as the upcoming elections draw near," Surfshark spokeswoman Gabriele Racaityte-Krasauske told TechRadar.
Turkey is the fourth-worst country in Asia by internet restrictions and first in Western Asia, Surfshark reports. The country counts, in fact, about 20 nation-scale mass-censorship incidents since 2016, according to data collected by UK-based internet watchdog NetBlocks.
The Turkish social media website Eksi Sozluk was restricted on the eve of the first round of elections. Some accounts and content was also taken down across online platforms like Twitter and Facebook recently. DDoS attacks on independent media sites during the election night and on the opposition's electoral result monitoring platform after the vote counting have also bolstered concerns. 
Despite these being relatively isolated incidents so far, Director of Research at Netblocks Isik Mater, who's currently in Istanbul monitoring the elections, told TechRadar: "Turkish people are hoping for the best but expecting the worst therefore preparing for possible disruptions by seeking alternative communication channels and ensuring they have access to reliable news sources." 

The stakes are even higher this time, since whoever wins the polls on May 28 will govern the country for the next five years.
President Erdoğan, who's been ruling the country for 20 years, can count on a solid alliance boosted by the recent endorsement of the third-place candidate. In the opposition there's Kemal Kilicdaroglu backed by six allied parties. After the first round on May 14, the candidates received 49.5% and 44.9% respectively.
"The current climate across the country is quite grim. Regardless of who wins the election, they will inherit numerous challenges including economic struggles, humanitarian crisis across earthquake affected areas, and the refugee crisis," explains Mater. 
"People are anxiously awaiting the election results as they believe it will determine the fate of the country and access to information is a key part of that." 
Short for virtual private network, a VPN is security software able to spoof users' IP address location so that they appear to be browsing the web from a completely different country within seconds. VPN services also encrypt all the data leaving a device for helping users enjoy better privacy when online. 
No wonder there was a huge increase in VPN downloads during the election days. However, this time, the trend seems to have been a bit different than usual.
"Normally we see spikes in sign ups in the hours following government censorship of social media, news sites and other similar online resources. The Turkish elections were unusual in that we saw a significant increase in sign ups (44,000 daily sign ups at peak) ahead of the first round of elections," a Proton VPN spokesperson told TechRadar.
"This would imply that people in Turkey were preparing themselves in case the government began a program of censorship. This also resulted in a spike in use, despite no increase in censorship that we are aware of, and today we still see daily use higher than pre-spike levels."
As we have seen, Turks are increasingly turning to circumvention tools to be ready in case Turkish authorities decide to throttle social media access and internet connection during the crucial hours leading to Sunday evening.
Experts encourage people to download different services so that users can hop among them in case of blocks. We also suggest checking our guide on the best free VPNs to ensure you're using a safe, high-quality product. On the other hand, Surfshark and some other providers are committed to supporting journalists, NGOs and activists in Turkey and elsewhere internet freedom is at risk, urging whoever is in need to reach out.
Racaityte from Surfshark said: "A potential internet restriction during the election could hinder the spread of crucial information that could shape the outcome of the election, undermining the very essence of democratic elections."

			Clashes over ecology threaten companyâs goal of building 1m cars in Europe each year
		
Teslaâs German gigafactory is polluting Berlinâs drinking water, a local utility company has claimed, as a fresh row engulfs Elon Muskâs flagship European electric car production plant.Officials from the local water authority near Teslaâs factory in GrÃ¼nheide have written to the regionâs mayors demanding the electric car company close its wastewater line until further notice.
If followed through with, the measure threatens to halt production at the German factory.
The regional water board has called for a general meeting on Friday to discuss its concerns that Teslaâs factory has been ejecting six times more hazardous pollutants into the water system than its permits allow, Stern magazine reported.Â âAlternatives are no longer available,â wrote the Strausberg-Erkner water association.
Stern reported Tesla had been warned five times since last March that its pollution levels were exceeding its agreed limits but it had not taken action. The levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water repeatedly exceeded allowable levels, the report claimed.
Opened in 2022, Tesla has been seeking to expand its factory to produce 1m cars per year, but the plant has suffered repeated delays as a result of red tape and protests from local green campaigners.
A Tesla spokesman told Stern its plant had wastewater facilities for a âfull recovery of processed waterâ and said its discharge had âno negative impactâ on local sewage treatment. A Tesla spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Local scientists claimed outflows from the factory ultimately ended up at a water plant near Berlin, which is then returned to the River Spree, potentially adding contaminants to the local drinking water.
Tesla has repeatedly clashed with the local water board, which has lobbied against the further expansion of the plant. Mr Musk has previously laughed off concerns the plant could threaten the regionâs water supply.
Despite local anger, German politicians have largely sought to appease Mr Musk, with the companyâs gigafactory creating thousands of local jobs.
However, local voters rejected Teslaâs latest plans to expand the factory by more than 50pc. GrÃ¼nheide residents voted by 3,499 to 1,822 to block Teslaâs proposals, which would have involved felling 250 acres of local forest.
The expansion plans would allow Tesla to hit its target of building 1m cars in Europe each year with a further 100 gigawatts of battery production capacity.
The carmaker said it would âseek dialogue with all participantsââ. Local protesters called the vote âan important victory for forest and water protection in GrÃ¼nheideâ.
Local opposition in Germany has proved a frustration for Mr Musk, with Tesla also locked in a conflict with unions in Sweden
Last year Mr Musk said he would âstrongly considerâ building a future battery plant in the UK after previously ruling out Britain over Brexit.

Mail Metro Media plans to launch two entertainment podcast series as part of its commitment to attract new audiences on audio and video platforms.
The news comes as 17% of consumer publishers surveyed by the Association of Online Publishers expected audio and podcasts to be the biggest drivers of growth in the next three years.
AOP survey: Digital publishers expect growth in podcasts and ecommerce

The new podcasts, Straight to the Comments and The Sidebar, were announced to advertising partners at an event on Wednesday, with the former launching in the coming weeks and the latter in March.
Hosted by YouTubers Archie Manners and Joshua Pieters, Straight to the Comments will feature celebrity guests reacting in real time to MailOnline’s comments section.
Meanwhile, The Sidebar, hosted by Richard Arnold, will bring together celebrity guests to discuss topical stories and scoops from MailOnline’s “celebrity sidebar”.
As part of a new focus on audio and video, the Daily Mail and Metro publisher appointed ex-GuardianÂ sales director Guy Edmunds to the newly created role of media director of video and podcast, and Jamie East as head of podcasts, in the past year.
East said the new shows were in the publisher’s “first phase of podcast releases” that have been “specially developed” to appeal to the publisher’s existing audience and attract new, engaged listeners, all while putting Mail Metro Media “firmly on the map” as one of the top publishers in the podcast space.
Dominic Williams, chief revenue officer at Mail Metro Media, said: âAudio and video are a real focus for us as a business right now â from a consumer and commercial perspective. As the largest publisher on TikTok and now with over 3m subscribers on YouTubeÂ­, we are in prime position to grow valuable audiences across all these platforms.
“These two new series launches couldnât be more fitting for MailOnline and bring exciting new opportunities for our advertising partners. Itâs an exciting step on our ambitious AV journey.â

A $600 million computing cloud built by an outside company is a "radical departure" for the risk-averse intelligence community. 
The intelligence community is about to get the equivalent of an adrenaline shot to the chest. This summer, a $600 million computing cloud developed by Amazon Web Services for the Central Intelligence Agency over the past year will begin servicing all 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community. If the technology plays out as officials envision, it will usher in a new era of cooperation and coordination, allowing agencies to share information and services much more easily and avoid the kind of intelligence gaps that preceded the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
For the first time, agencies within the intelligence community will be able to order a variety of on-demand computing and analytic services from the CIA and National Security Agency. Whatâs more, theyâll only pay for what they use.
The vision was first outlined in the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise plan championed by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and IC Chief Information Officer Al Tarasiuk almost three years ago. Cloud computing is one of the core components of the strategy to help the IC discover, access and share critical information in an era of seemingly infinite data.
For the risk-averse intelligence community, the decision to go with a commercial cloud vendor is a radical departure from business as usual.
In 2011, while private companies were consolidating data centers in favor of the cloud and some civilian agencies began flirting with cloud variants like email as a service, a sometimes contentious debate among the intelligence communityâs leadership took place.
As one former intelligence official with knowledge of the Amazon deal told Government Executive, âIt took a lot of wrangling, but it was easy to see the vision if you laid it all out.â The critical question was would the IC, led by the CIA, attempt to do cloud computing from within, or would it buy innovation? Money was a factor, according to the intelligence official, but not the leading one.
The government was spending more money on information technology within the IC than ever before. IT spending reached $8 billion in 2013, according to budget documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The CIA and other agencies feasibly could have spent billions of dollars standing up their own cloud infrastructure without raising many eyebrows in Congress, but the decision to purchase a single commercial solution came down primarily to two factors.
âWhat we were really looking at was time to mission and innovation,â the former intelligence official said. âThe goal was, âCan we act like a large enterprise in the corporate world and buy the thing that we donât have, can we catch up to the commercial cycle? Anybody can build a data center, but could we purchase something more?
âWe decided we needed to buy innovation,â the former intelligence official said.
The CIAâs first request for proposals from industry in mid-2012 was met with bid protests to the Government Accountability Office from Microsoft and AT&T, two early contenders for the contract. Those protests focused on the narrow specifications called for by the RFP. GAO did not issue a decision in either protest because the CIA reworked its request to address the companiesâ complaint.
In early 2013, after weighing bids from Amazon Web Services, IBM and an unnamed third vendor, the CIA awarded a contract to AWS worth up to $600 million over a period of up to 10 years. The deal, handled in secret, was first reported by FCW in March 2013, sending ripples through the tech industry.
A month after the deal became public, IBM filed a bid protest with GAO that the watchdog eventually upheld in June, forcing the CIA to reopen bids to both companies for the contract. A legal struggle between Amazon and Big Blue ensued, and AWS filed a lawsuit against the federal government in July 2013, claiming the GAO sustainment was a âflawedâ decision.
In October, U.S. Court of Federal Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler sided with Amazon and overturned GAOâs decision to force the CIA to rebid the contract. Big Blue went home, AWS claimed victory under the dealâs original financial specs, and nearly 18 months after the procurement was first released, the CIA and Amazon went to work.
It is difficult to underestimate the cloud contractâs importance. In a recent public appearance, CIA Chief Information Officer Douglas Wolfe called it âone of the most important technology procurements in recent history,â with ramifications far outside the realm of technology.
âItâs going to take a few months to bring this online in a robust way, but itâs coming,â Wolfe said. Â âAnd I think itâs going to make a big difference for national security.â
The Amazon-built cloud will operate behind the ICâs firewall, or more simply: Itâs a public cloud built on private premises.
Intelligence agencies will be able to host applications or order a variety of on-demand services like storage, computing and analytics. True to the National Institute of Standards and Technology definition of cloud computing, the IC cloud scales up or down to meet the need.
In that regard, customers will pay only for services they actually use, which is expected to generate massive savings for the IC.
âWe see this as a tremendous opportunity to sharpen our focus and to be very efficient,â Wolfe told an audience at AWSâ annual nonprofit and government symposium in Washington. âWe hope to get speed and scale out of the cloud, and a tremendous amount of efficiency in terms of folks traditionally using IT now using it in a cost-recovery way.â
Many agencies within the IC already have identified applications to move to the cloud. In a recent report, National Reconnaissance Office Chief Information Officer Donna Hansen said her agency had picked five applications, including its enterprise resource planning software, to migrate to the IC cloud. As with public clouds, the IC cloud will maximize automation and require standardized information, which will be shared through application programming interfaces, known as APIs. Amazon engineers will oversee the hardware because AWS owns the hardware and is responsible for maintaining it just as they do in the companyâs public data centers.
Whenever Amazon introduces a new innovation or improvement in cloud services, the IC cloud will evolve. Company officials say AWS made more than 200 such incremental improvements last year, ensuring a sort of built-in innovation to the IC cloud that will help the intelligence community keep pace with commercial advances. Wolfe said AWSâ capacity to bring commercial innovation from places like Silicon Valley to the IC is one of the contractâs greatest benefits. Whenever AWS introduces new products, the CIA will be able to implement them.
âThe biggest thing we were trying to doâthe visionary folks a couple years agoâwas answer the question, âHow do we keep up?ââ Wolfe said. âThe mission we have is important. The pace and complexity is really not [diminishing], in fact, it may be increasing. We feel it is very important to deliver the best IT and best products and services we can to our customers in the IC.â
What of the data, though? Intelligence agencies are drowning in it, collecting and analyzing an amalgamation of information from sensors, satellites, surveillance efforts, open data repositories and human intelligence, among other sources. Is that data really secure in the cloud?
The CIA is convinced it is.
The IC cloud âwill be accredited and compliant with IC standards,â says a senior CIA official familiar with the IC cloud. It will, for example, be able to handle Sensitive Compartmented Information, a type of classified information. âSecurity in the IC cloud will be as safe as or safer than security on our current data centers,â the senior CIA official says. Because the IC cloud will serve multiple tenantsâthe 17 agencies that comprise the ICâadministrators will be able to restrict access to information based on the identity of the individual seeking it. The idea is to foster collaboration without compromising security. Visually, the IC cloud can be thought of as a workspace hanging off the ICâs shared networkâa place where data can be loaded for a variety of tasks like computing or sharing. The IC cloud gives agencies additional means to share information in an environment where automated security isnât a barrier to the sharing itself. This could prove vital in situations reminiscent of 9/11, in which national security is an immediate concern.
Cloud vendors, including Amazon, have argued that cloud infrastructures can be more secure than traditional data centers because there are fewer points of entry, but the leaks by Snowden illustrate the potential threat from inside an organization. Snowden was able to access and download classified information intelligence officials said he shouldnât have been able to access.
To access information within the IC cloud, analysts must have the proper permissions. In addition, the standardized environment and automation means all activity within the cloud is logged and can be analyzed in near real-time.
Some government officials view cloud computing as inherently less secure than computing on locally controlled servers, but the CIAâs acceptance of commercially developed cloud technology âhas been a wake-up callâ to those who balk at it, according to John Pirc, a former CIA cybersecurity researcher who is now chief technology officer at NSS Labs, a security research firm.
âYou hear so many people on the fence about cloud, and then to see the CIA gobble it up and do something so highly disruptive, itâs kind of cool,â says Pirc. âTo me, this removes the clouded judgment that cloud isnât secure. Their moving forward with this should send a message to the rest of the industry that cloud is something you shouldnât be afraid of.â
Pirc is no stranger to disruptive technologies. At the CIAâs research labs in the early 2000s, he recalls virtualizationâa technology that allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on the same servers, allowing for far more efficient computingâbefore it became an integral component of many IT enterprises. Â Intelligence agencies use commercial off-the-shelf technology all the time, but to Pirc, the importance of the cloud capabilities the CIA gets through leveraging Amazon Web Servicesâ horsepower is best exemplified in computing intelligence data. Scalable computing is critical for fostering shared services and enhanced collaboration between disparate intelligence agencies.
âWhat it allows them to do is spin up servers and add more [computing power] fast, and when youâre computing intelligence data, the more compute power you have, the faster you can react,â Pirc says. âIn the private sector, compute is all about money and profit, but from my viewpoint when I worked for the agency, youâre working with extremely time-sensitive information. Being able to have that compute power, something that might have taken a couple of hours might instead take a few seconds. Profits arenât lost when you make mistakes in the intelligence communityâpeople die when you make mistakes.â
A test scenario described by GAO in its June 2013 bid protest opinion suggests the CIA sought to compare how the solutions presented by IBM and Amazon Web Services could crunch massive data sets, commonly referred to as big data.
Solutions had to provide a âhosting environment for applications which process vast amounts of information in parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardwareâ using a platform called MapReduce. Through MapReduce, clusters were provisioned for computation and segmentation. Test runs assumed clusters were large enough to process 100 terabytes of raw input data. AWSâ solution received superior marks from CIA procurement officials, according to GAO documentation, and was one of the chief reasons the agency selected Amazon.
The CIA declined to comment when Government Executive asked about the extent of the IC cloudâs capabilities or that of the National Security Agencyâs cloud. Amazon also declined to describe the IC cloudâs technical capabilities.
It is a good bet, though, that the AWS-built cloud for the IC will have capabilities at least equal to existing capabilities Amazon has already implemented across government.
For example, the company provides the cloud bandwidth for the Securities and Exchange Commissionâs collection of more than 1 billion trade records and more than a terabyte of new data per day through its Market Information Data Analytics System. This example may be prescient given that now-public surveillance efforts indicate the IC collects billions and perhaps trillions of pieces of metadata, phone and Internet records, and other various bits of information on an annual basis. The potential exists for the CIA to become one of AWSâ largest customers.
Within the intelligence community, examples abound where the cloudâs capabilities could significantly boost the mission.
As the geospatial hub of the community, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency ingests, analyzes, metatags and reports all geo-intelligence and multisource content in its flagship program called Map of the World. Geospatial dataâs importance to the IC has increased in recent years, as evidenced by NGAâs nearly $5 billion budget and its staff nearly doubling in size since 2004. For intensive applications like ingesting or analyzing geospatial data, scalable computing could have a significant impact on mission performance. The cloud also could improve the way the agency shares its large data sets.
What the IC has done with cloud is not easily replicable, according to American Council for Technology President Rick Holgate, but it is worth paying attention to.
âThe IC has a model other agencies should look to and aspire to in terms of transforming the way they think about delivering services across a large enterprise,â Holgate says. âThey are looking to common platforms and service delivery models across an entire enterprise, and not just gaining cost efficiencies, but to provide foundational capabilities to really allow it to operate.â
Whether or not the IC cloud serves as an example for the rest of government, the CIAâs quest to buy innovation will loom large for years to come.
The Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise lays out a vision for the ICâs 17 agencies to securely discover, access and share information. The goal: greater mission success.
In essence, ICITE (pronounced EYEsite) changes the business model for intelligence agencies by requiring that Â they share services.
Cloud computingâbehind the ICâs firewallâis one element of that vision. Think of it as the intelligence community sharing information behind a walled castle apart from the rest of the world operating on the Internet.
The Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency are leading IC cloud development; the NSAâs privately hosted cloud was launched in 2013. Importantly, it was made available to users on new and legacy systems so that personnel on any of its systems could use it. The cloud built by Amazon Web Services at the behest of the CIA will be a shared resource for services on an as-needed basis. Intelligence agencies can order a variety of services like storage, computing, analytics, database services or application hosting. Both clouds will work in complementary fashion, according to senior CIA officials.
Other ICITE components include a common desktop, an IC-wide applications mall, and network requirement and engineering services.
The Defense Intelligence Agency and National-Geospatial Intelligence Agency have piloted shared desktop capabilities across their agencies for several thousand users. Those capabilities eventually will spread throughout the IC.
In essence, ICITE changes the business model for intelligence agencies, mandating shared services. Instead of each agency building out its own systems, select agenciesâeither one or two of those with larger budgetsâare responsible for governing its major components.
In cloud computing, thereâs Amazon Web Services and then thereâs everybody else.
IT research firm Gartner had to rescale its famed infrastructure-as-a- service âMagic Quadrantâ study in 2013 to accommodate Amazon Web Servicesâ enormous competitive lead.
The quadrant ranks cloud providers based on their ability to execute operations and the comprehensiveness of their vision. For several years there hasnât been even a close challenger to AWS. Gartnerâs 2014 quadrant shows that AWS captures 83 percent of the cloud computing infrastructure market.
In the combined cloud markets for infrastructure and platform services, hybrid and private cloudsâworth a collective $131 billion at the end of 2013âAmazonâs revenue grew 67 percent in the first quarter of 2014, according to Gartner.
While the public sector hasnât been as quick to capitalize on cloud computing as the private sector, government spending on cloud technologies is beginning to jump.
Researchers at IDC estimate federal private cloud spending will reach $1.7 billion in 2014, and $7.7 billion by 2017. In other industries, software services are considered the leading cloud technology, but in the government that honor goes to infrastructure services, which IDC expects to reach $5.4 billion in 2017.
In addition to its $600 million deal with the CIA, Amazon Web Services also does business with NASA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most recently, the Obama Administration tapped AWS to host portions of HealthCare.gov.

Concerns raised over what a third term for Narendra Modi would mean for the country amid rising Hindu-Muslim tension
Indiaâs prime minister, Narendra Modi, has cut a confident figure in recent weeks. As his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) swept three major state elections in December, Modi did not hold back from predicting that âthis hat-trick has guaranteed the 2024 victoryâ.
It was a sign that with less than six months to go before the general election, in which Modi will be seeking a third term in power, campaign season has begun with gusto.
In Indiaâs current political landscape, the consensus among political analysts is that a win for Modi and the BJP is the most plausible outcome.
The prime ministerâs popularity as a political strongman, alongside the BJPâs Hindu nationalist agenda, continues to appeal to the large Hindu majority of the country, particularly in the populous Hindi belt of the north, resulting in the widespread persecution of Muslims.
At state and national level, the apparatus of the country has been skewed heavily towards the BJP since Modi was elected in 2014. He has been accused of overseeing an unprecedented consolidation of power, muzzling critical media, eroding the independence of the judiciary and all forms of parliamentary scrutiny and accountability and using government agencies to pursue and jail political opponents.
While regional opposition to the BJP is strong in pockets of south and east India, nationally it is seen as fragmented and weak. The main opposition Indian National Congress party won the state election in Telangana this month but is in power in only three states overall and is perceived as hierarchical and riddled with infighting.
The recently formed coalition of all major opposition parties â which goes by the acronym INDIA â has yet to unite on crucial issues, though it has vowed to fight the BJP collectively.
âThe general sense is that a BJP win is almost an inevitability at this stage,â said Neelanjan Sircar, a fellow at the Centre for Policy research. âThe question is more: what factors will shape the scale of the victory?â
The BJP has begun a nationwide pre-election push. A roadshow, titled Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, will see thousands of government officers deployed to towns and villages across the country over the next two months, tasked with speaking about the BJPâs successes over the past nine years â despite criticisms of politicising government bureaucracy and resources for campaigning purposes.
The Ministry of Defence is also setting up 822 âselfie pointsâ at war memorials, defence museums, railway stations and tourist attractions where people can take photos of themselves with a Modi cutout.
The BJPâs recent domination in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh appeared to reaffirm the popularity of Modi. Though the prime minister has little to do with state elections, which are designed to elect local assembly members, the BJP strategically put Modi front and centre of their campaigns in the place of local leaders, where he appeared at dozens of rallies to directly appeal to voters and present himself as the embodiment of the party.
Modiâs messaging in these campaign speeches combined an emphasis on the BJPâs paternalistic welfare schemes â which provide large amounts of free food and cash handouts â with nationalistic and religiously communal rhetoric, offering a glimpse of how the BJP intends to fight the election on a national scale.
Modiâs role in elevating India as a global power â be that in international politics or in the recent its moon landing in August â it was the first country to successfully land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole â was also prominent.
Asim Ali, a political scientist, said the recent state election campaigns in the north were âsome of the most religiously polarising I have seenâ as the BJP played heavily on Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) sentiments to win the majority vote.
In Rajasthan, Modi repeatedly evoked an incident where a Hindu tailor was murdered by extremist Muslims to claim that the opposition Congress party, which ruled the state, was âsympathetic to terroristsâ and that it was their appeasement of Muslims that had led to the killing.
The BJPâs candidates included four Hindu priests, some with very hardline views, but no Muslims. In the tribal dominated state of Chhattisgarh, the BJP played on fears of forced conversions of tribal people away from Hinduism.
Modi was brought to power in 2014 largely on the back of an anti-incumbency wave while his re-election victory in 2019 was all but secured after India carried out airstrikes on Pakistan, after a terrorist incident a few months before the polls, resulting in a storm of national security sentiment in his favour.
However, whether the BJP will win the same sort of sweeping parliamentary majority it secured in 2019 is unclear. Its position in certain crucial states, such as Bihar and Maharashtra, is uncertain and the partyâs weakness on economic problems, particularly jobs and inflation, could also affect voting.
Ali was among those who feared a Hindu-Muslim divide would be stirred up further to become âthe dominant issue, at least in the Hindi heartlandâ.
âHindu-Muslim communalisation has become completely normalised, not just through political campaigning but by the television news channels and the messages people see on social media and WhatsApp,â said Ali. âIt can be activated by the BJP at their grassroots at any time. Just one or two slogans from Modi and other senior BJP leaders, a few coded communal dogwhistles, and people get the message.â
Indeed, one of the biggest issues likely to dominate the BJPâs agenda pre-election is the long-awaited opening of the Ram Mandir, a grand Hindu temple that has been built in the place of a demolished mosque. Construction of the building, in the north Indian town of Ayodhya, has long been a focal point of the Hindu nationalist movement in India, and the fanfare around Modiâs inauguration of the temple later this month in January is expected to be a national event.
Baijayant Panda, national vice president of the BJP, said the party was very confident about the parliamentary elections. He credited the confidence in part to âthe Modi premiumâ, which meant the BJP tended to perform better in national than state elections because of the âstratospheric popularityâ of the prime minister.
âOn the ground, thereâs a huge surge of optimism, even in areas which we havenât traditionally won,â said Panda. âHaving had this kind of victory in the state elections completely cements our position.â
Exactly what a third term for Modi would mean for India, particularly if it was another outright majority, was a cause for concern among some analysts and human rights groups. While Panda said it would be defined by economic success, and India becoming the worldâs third largest economy, others feared a continued erosion of democracy and the rights of the Muslim minority, who exceed 200 million.
Ashutosh Varshney, the director of the Center for Contemporary South Asia at Brown University in the US, said he expected the rights of Muslims to continue to come under attack.
He warned that a situation similar to the Jim Crow laws, which existed in southern American states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and disenfranchised black people on the basis of race, could become a reality in India under a third Modi term.
âIf Modi comes back to power we can imagine a scenario of a Jim Crow-style Hindu nationalist order in BJP-ruled states,â said Varshney. âIt will establish Hindu supremacy, deprive Muslims of equality and create a secondary citizenship for Muslims, which will likely eventually remove their right to vote.â
Panda pushed back against allegations of BJP communalism. âI dare anyone to point out where a minority, whether a Muslim or a Christian or Buddhist or a Sikh has been discriminated against in the governance of India, you will not find a single example,â he said.

The rare use of public records law to target citizens is a new escalation in the stateâs battle with the EPA over its examination of alleged civil rights violations in the heavily polluted region known as âCancer Alley.â  
Louisiana sued the EPA on December 19, alleging that the federal agency had failed to properly respond to the stateâs sprawling Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, request sent by former state attorney general Jeff Landry.
Court filings note that the public records case is related to another, ongoing lawsuit brought against the EPA by Landry, a staunch advocate for the oil and gas industry who now serves as Louisianaâs governor. Shortly after Landryâs suit was filed, the EPA dropped its probe into the Louisiana Department of Environmental Qualityâs permitting practices, which advocates say disproportionately impact Black residents in Cancer Alley.
News that the state has sought to obtain such an array of communications as part of its efforts prompted allegations of intimidation from many of the Black residents who were targeted. It has also raised press freedom concerns for media organizations included in the request, described by FOIA experts as extremely unusual. 
âThe Louisiana attorney generalâs office protects industry more than they protect the people,â said Sharon Lavigne, a resident of St. James Parish who has long fought industrial proliferation in her community and whose emails were targeted in the request. âMaybe thatâs why they got all of these emails, just to see what weâre doing and to see how they can stop us.â 
Members of Rise St. James, conduct a livestream video on property owned by Formosa on March 11, 2020, in St. James Parish, La.
Landry filed the request on June 29, 2023, just one day after the EPA announced it was dropping its Cancer Alley civil rights investigation. 
The request seeks all records since March 2021 regarding âenvironmental justice in Louisiana, the Industrial Corridor in Louisiana,â and âthe area called Cancer Alley.â It lists six advocates by name, all of whom are Black, as well as the organizations Rise St. James, the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, and several other community and law groups who have represented Cancer Alley residents.
Due to the expansive nature of the request, the EPA said it would take more than a year to locate and provide all the records. Louisiana then sued to compel the agency to move more quickly.
The Louisiana attorney generalâs office declined to answer questions from The Guardian and The Intercept over why it had requested such information, but filings in its FOIA lawsuit accuse the EPA of âprodigiously leaking information to the pressâ and allowing environmental advocacy groups to hold undue influence on decisions. 
An environmental law group said the attorney generalâs accusations of external influence were hypocritical, noting that Landry’s office previously hired petrochemical lawyers to represent the state in its negotiations with the EPA. Those same lawyers were simultaneously representing one of the companies at the center of the EPAâs civil rights investigation, the Taiwanese petrochemical giant Formosa.
Landryâs request specifically seeks records containing mention of Formosa, as well as the Japanese firm Denka. Both companies are at the heart of ongoing campaigns and litigation in the region. Lavigneâs group, Rise St James, has been instrumental in thus far stopping Formosa from building a massive, multibillion-dollar plastics plant in their parish. A Louisiana appeals court recently reinstated Formosaâs air permits, overturning a 2022 ruling.
The request also asks for emails with national and local media including MSNBC, the Washington Post, and The Advocate, specifying nine journalists by name.
The co-author of this article, The Guardianâs Oliver Laughland, was one of the named journalists. âWe are deeply concerned by what appears to be an attempt to intimidate journalists and interfere with their ability to report on alarming matters of environmental injustice â in particular, the dangerous toxicity of air in predominantly Black areas of Louisiana,â said Guardian U.S. general counsel Kai Falkenberg. âFOIA is an essential tool for informing the public on the workings of government, but in this case, weâre concerned that the State of Louisiana is abusing that law to prevent reporters from engaging in newsgathering on matters of public interest to readers in Louisiana and around the world.â 
The EPA declined to answer questions from The Guardian and The Intercept, citing ongoing litigation, but it provided the 940 pages of documents already handed to the Louisiana Department of Justice. Further releases are scheduled for February 2.
The documents, many of which were heavily redacted, contain typical requests for comment from several journalists, internal EPA discussions over drafting and scheduling, and EPA exchanges with environmental lawyers and nonprofits, including a list of the attendees at a meeting of leading Cancer Alley advocates.
The Denka Performance Elastomer Plant in Reserve, La., on Sept. 23, 2022.
Public records law in the U.S. dictates that, with certain exemptions, communications by or with local, state, and federal employees must be made available to the public. The law is intended to preserve government transparency.
David Cuillier, director of the Freedom of Information Project, said that requests for communications between the government and citizens, including journalists, are not uncommon. But those requests are typically made by other journalists, law groups, or members of the public â not state governments. 
âItâs totally weird and rare for a government agency to request, one, records from another agency, and, two, all the communications about these advocates and citizens and journalists,â Cuillier said.
Bill Quigley, longtime director of Loyola University New Orleansâs Law Clinic, also noted that âit is not at all common for states to sue the federal government over FOIA disputes.â
In a previous survey, Cuillier and his colleague found that only about 2 percent of public records requests are made by another government agency. Cuillier argued it would be in the best interests of Louisianaâs Department of Justice to be transparent over the FOIAâs purpose. Otherwise, he said, it gives the appearance that the state is âspying on political opponents.â
An environmental group likewise said that the requests, while lawful, would have a chilling effect on local advocatesâ efforts â including those not specifically named by the request. The group, which asked not to be named, suggested the records request is an attempt to shift the narrative, framing the EPA as suspect, rather than polluters themselves.
Robert Taylor, an 83-year-old lifelong resident of St. John Parish who leads a grassroots group fighting against pollution linked to Denka’s plant, said it was âfrighteningâ and âhorribleâ to know the state government had targeted his emails. 
âItâs certainly intimidation. What other reason could there be for it?â Taylor said.
Louisianaâs lawsuit against the EPAâs Cancer Alley investigation is ongoing and expected to advance to the Supreme Court. In a recent hearing, Judge James D. Cain, appointed by former President Donald Trump, rejected the EPA’s motion to dismiss and appears ready to side with Louisiana, citing âthe whims of the EPA and its overarching mandate.â Cain, who is also presiding over Louisianaâs FOIA lawsuit, issued a ruling on January 23 temporarily blocking the EPA from enforcing some aspects of civil rights law in Louisiana.
Troy Carter, Louisianaâs lone Democrat in Congress whose district includes the Cancer Alley region, urged the state government to drop both lawsuits against the EPA and its pursuit of records. 
âThis would remove any need for these citizens’ private conversations with the government to be disclosed,â Carter said. âThe First Amendment protects the right to free speech. The government should not have any appearance of targeting private individuals in a manner that could inhibit freedom.â

SHARON Osbourne is being lined up to star in Celebrity Big Brother â in a reunion with her X Factor pal Louis Walsh.
Sharon, 71, is set to fly to the UK next week from the US where she lives with rocker hubby Ozzy.
Fellow judge Louis, also 71, has reportedly reached a deal to enter the CBB house â so it would be the first time in seven years they have been on screen together.
A TV source said: âLanding Sharon is a huge coup for the series, especially as she has such a strong on-screen partnership with Louis.
âShe isnât afraid to say whatâs on her mind and has a wealth of showbiz stories up her sleeves. 
"She is guaranteed entertainment and sure to be a hit with viewers.â
CBB, now on ITV1, starts on March 4. 
Others signed up include Kate Middleton'sÂ uncleÂ Gary Goldsmith, ex-This Morning host Fern Britton, 66, Â and Love islanderÂ Ekin-Su CÃ¼lcÃ¼loÄlu, 29.
A spokeswoman for the show said: âAll names are purely speculation at this stage.â
Sharon recently opened up about losing three stone using fat-melting jab Ozempic but claimed she needed to put weight back on.

She said; âI started using it in November last year. I was 142lb [10st 2lb] when I started using it. For the first two or three weeks 
"I felt very nauseous.
"The nausea went away, but once youâre on it you donât feel hungry and you donât eat. 
"Itâs not talked about but you can get a blockage in your bowel. I havenât been on it for three or four months.
"My weight has stabilised. I went down to about 97lb [6st 13lb] and it was like, 'Oh no.' I needed to put some weight back on, which I have.â

The cryptocurrency boom has given rise to a new kind of malware attack, with attacks growing ever more frequent as coin prices rise. A report today from Symantec details a surge in coin-mining scripts, which are often planted by hackers in the background of public websites. Once running, the script uses the visitorâs CPU to mine cryptocurrency, a power-intensive process that can be far more lucrative than traditional malware.
Anti-virus tools like Symantecâs typically identify and block such programs, giving the firm a clear view into how widespread the miners are on the open web. Miner programs seem to track tightly with the price of Monero itself, which means theyâve seen a surge of activity in recent weeks. 
Symantecâs data shows daily detections clearing three million for the first time at the end of November, just as prices were beginning to rise above $200. Notably, Moneroâs price has risen considerably since that data, clearing $350 per coin on December 16.
Malicious mining programs typically mine the Monero currency rather than Bitcoin or Ethereum, drawn largely by Moneroâs CPU-friendly hashing algorithm. Cryptocurrency prices tend to be tightly correlated, so Moneroâs price has largely risen in sync with Bitcoin itself.
The most popular background miner is Coinhive, which surfaced in September and was quickly blocked by a number of security firms. Coinhiveâs official site has since disappeared in favor of an opt-in variant, but Symantecâs research shows the original plugin is alive and well.
The plugins are most profitable when they can run in the background for significant periods of time, due to the nature of cryptocurrency mining. Thatâs made mining plugins particularly attractive for streaming sites, although theyâre usually installed by third-party hackers without the permission of the site owners themselves. In September, Coinhive was discovered in the background of two Showtime websites. The application also been discovered in Chrome extensions and briefly installed by Pirate Bay as a purposeful revenue measure.
Symantec also discovered miners in a number Android apps. The resulting work would have been far less effective on an underpowered mobile CPUs, but it hasnât slowed the growth of the tactic. Symantec listed 35 separate Android apps with mining functions in 2017 so far, a 34 percent increase from last year.

Actress plays the character Tannis in the film directed by Eli Roth
Jamie Lee Curtis has joined Cate Blanchett and Kevin Hart in the cast of âBorderlands,â the adaptation of the popular video game franchise that is set up at Lionsgate.
Curtis will play Tannis, an archeologist on Pandora who might have the key to finding the vault, but whose complicated history with Lilith (Blanchett) isnât going to help.
Eli Roth is directing the film based on the video game franchise.
âWorking with the iconic Jamie Lee Curtis has been a lifelong dream of mine, and I am so excited for her to bring her humor, warmth and brilliance to the role of Tannis,â Roth said in a statement.
The latest draft of the âBorderlandsâ screenplay is by Craig Mazin (âChernobylâ). Avi Arad and Ari Arad are producing through their Arad Productions banner, with Erik Feig also producing through PICTURESTART.
âBorderlandsâ is based on the PC and console trilogy from Gearbox Software and publisher 2K. The series is a visceral first-person shooter and roleplaying game about four âVault Huntersâ on a planet called Pandora who battle against local bandits and marauders in their search for a hidden vault rumored to contain advanced alien technology.
The âBorderlandsâ games have sold 66 million units sold-in worldwide, including over 24 million units of âBorderlands 2,â which is the highest selling title in the history of 2K. The most recent installment, âBorderlands 3,â launched in September 2019 and was recently released for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. âBorderlands 3â has sold more than 11 million units worldwide and was honored with the award for Best Multiplayer Game at Gamescom 2019 and Best Ongoing Game at Gamescom 2020.
The filmâs executive producers are Randy Pitchford, executive producer of the âBorderlandsâ video game franchise and founder of the Gearbox Entertainment Company, and Strauss Zelnick, chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive.
James Myers and Aaron Edmonds are overseeing the project on behalf of Lionsgate. Emmy Yu is overseeing the film for Arad Productions. Lucy Kitada and Royce Reeves-Darby are overseeing the project for PICTURESTART.
âThe kind of talent weâve been able to bring together for âBorderlandsâ is a testament to the incredible script that Craig wrote and Eliâs vision for Pandora,â Lionsgate motion picture group president Nathan Kahane said in a statement. âJamie is unique in that her characters have depth and gravitas, but are also always hugely entertaining â she commands the screen. At this point, Jamie is like family to us â after bringing so much to âKnives Outâ and hosting last summerâs âLionsgate Liveâ fundraiser to help theater workers, we could not be more thrilled to be working with her again.â
Jamie Lee Curtis last starred in âKnives Outâ for Lionsgate, and sheâll next be seen in the âHalloweenâ reboot sequels âHalloween Killsâ and âHalloween Ends.â
Robert Melnik negotiated the deal on behalf of Lionsgate.

After a year of waiting this website is upgraded to Drupal 8. All the content is migrated, but we are missing some functionality. But overall the migration went well.
This week I made my first Jolla phone app. I use a Jolla phone for a year now. And it works nicely. The fact that it is running Linux is the reason I bought it.
The last month, the livecounter.theyosh.nl website had a busy period. Almost every day we reached 900+ requests per second. That is about 30.000+ users that is seeing the counter. The problem that arises is that there not enough upload bandwidth. We have updated the livecounter under the hood, in such a way, that we can not handle 40.000+ users!! That is an increase of 33%!
After almost 7 months there is a new update of Dreambox ReStream software. Due to the fact that we are currently happy with the software, the amount of updates is low. We think there is no need for updates except for bugs and or security related issues. If there are still wishes, please mail them to: dreambox [at] theyosh.nl

Income investors are always on the hunt for steady and strong dividends, but many of them would not consider Asia to be the place to go looking.
However, Mike Kerley, of Henderson Far East Income has rewarded investors willing to back his investment trust with a solid stream of dividends combined with share price growth in recent years.
The trust has a total return of 151.6 per cent over the past decade and 46 per cent over the past three years, while currently yielding 5.98 per cent.
So why should investors look to Asia for income? Mike joins Simon Lambert and Richard Hunter on the latest investing Show to explain how he looks for high dividends, combined with value and a solid balance sheet that has the backing of lots of cash.
He looks for a combination of companies that offer either high yields and sustainable dividends, or those that offer potential dividend growth such as Australiaâs Treasury Wine Estates.
Mike also eyes those companies that can use that cash pile to fund dividend growth in the future.
Mike explains how he looks for companies for the trust, why maturing businesses in Asia offer good opportunities and the growth in Asia should back up their future prospects â and he gives his thoughts on what may happen next for China.

Lady Gaga has the world at her feet now, but she's getting no "Applause" from a former college classmate -- Carly Waddell claims the singer's behavior would "drive her crazy."
"Bachelor" alum Carly is also a singer -- though she's more known for her TV dating conquests -- and while on ex-"Bachelor" star Jason Tartick's podcast, "Trading Secrets," she revealed she was "not a fan" of Gaga back when they were both attending NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.
Case in point ... Carly said that Gaga -- who went by her real name, Stefani, back then -- would dismiss basic lunchtime etiquette, singing "Wicked" at the top of her lungs while on the piano as others tried to eat in peace ... every single day.
Carly said, "It was break time, and we were forced to listen to her" ... which she found so irritating, she started eating her lunch in the hallway just to flee Gaga's singing.
But did Gaga's flair for performing arts put her above everyone else in class? Carly says no ... but with Grammys, an Academy Award & many more accolades under her belt, she acknowledges that Gaga is NOW above everyone else.
So, considering Gaga's age-old mantra, it's probs best to not be annoying AF if you need one person to believe in you in a room full of 100.

Download the Ratings »
The television industry designed a TV ratings system – known as the TV Parental Guidelines – to give parents more information about the content and age-appropriateness of TV program.
The TV ratings can be used in conjunction with the V-Chip â a device built into most television sets â to allow parents to block out programs they don't want their children to see. Parental control technology in cable and satellite set-top boxes can also be used with the TV Parental Guidelines to block programs based on their rating. 
The TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board is comprised of experts from the television industry and public interest advocates who are responsible for ensuring there is as much uniformity and consistency in applying the Parental Guidelines as possible. The Board also reviews complaints about specific program ratings to help ensure accuracy.

                                        Budget Billing is a stable payment plan available to UPPCO customers that allows you to pay an average amount  that stays the same monthly. UPPCO reviews your usage at 6 and 9 months to determine if your budget amount should be adjusted.
                                    

                                        With budget billing, you can avoid âhighs and lowsâ in your bills throughout the year caused by seasonal changes in how much energy you use.

                                        The difference between the actual bill charges and your established Budget Bill
                                        amount each month is maintained as a deferred balance.
                                    

                                        If your deferred balance is lower than your budget billing projection, your
                                        account receives a credit.
                                    

                                        If your deferred balance is higher than your budget billing projection, your
                                        account will be charged the difference.
                                    

                                        UPPCO customer service works with every Budget Billing Customer to come as close

                                        added together and reflected on this line.
Note: This customer has enrolled in Auto Pay since their last bill. Normally,

                                        If your deferred balance is lower than your budget billing projection, your
                                        account receives a credit.
                                    

                                        If your deferred balance is higher than your budget billing projection, your
                                        account will be charged the difference.

The reading in the example below is 94838: 

Reading your electric meter is straightforward. For mechanical meters, the dials, which look like little clocks, alternately run clockwise and counterclockwise. Reading from left to right, write down the last number the needle has passed. If the needle is between two numbers, UPPCO will use the lower of the two numbers. When the needle is between a 9 and 0, the 9 is used. As an example, the correct reading concerning the dials above is 94838.* The difference between the new reading and the previous reading is your monthly energy use.
*Dial 4 is still read as a 3 despite the needle being on 4 because the dial to its right has not passed 0.
Residential Digital Meters 
UPPCO digital meters will scroll through a number of different screens while operating. Your energy consumption will appear as five or six digits on the screen. Ignore any screens that contain all 0s and all 8s.

UPPCO will only estimate your energy usage if unable to receive communication from your smart meter and/or is unable to access your smart meter or non-standard meter. If you have questions about this, contact Customer Service at (906) 449-2013.

Absolutely not! Automatic Payment is a free service from UPPCO, although your financial institution may charge for this type of transaction. You may want to call them and ask. However, you will still save the money youâre currently spending on stamps, gasoline and checks.
Will I still get a bill from UPPCO?
Yes, just like you do currently. And the upcoming date and amount of the Automatic Payment will be printed right on the bill, so youâll know exactly how much will be deducted and when. Youâll have plenty of time to review and call with any questions before the payment is made.

What is Budget Billing?
Budget Billing is when we review your past energy use, estimate your total energy costs over the next year and then simply bill you for 1/12 each month.
Why is it better than just paying UPPCO for what I use each month?
Budget Billing spreads your energy charges out evenly over the entire year, helping you better manage your energy bills. No matter what the weather is like, you know youâll pay about the same amount every month.
How does Budget Billing work?
The budget year begins with your first bill after joining the plan. You pay equal amounts until your Budget Billing anniversary, which is your twelfth month on the plan. At this time we true-up any difference between what you paid and the actual costs of the energy you used.
What if I paid too much?
Itâs simple. If you paid too much, the difference will be applied as a credit to your bill at the end of the Budget Billing year.
What if I paid too little?
If you paid too little, you can pay the difference outright or contact us for an installment plan on the difference.
Does the budget amount ever change?
Yes, occasionally. Your account is reviewed periodically because there are several reasons why your budget amount may go up or down. Besides rate changes and unusual weather, lifestyle changes like a new baby in the home can alter your energy use. Also, adding or removing equipment such as an air conditioner, swimming pool, hot tub, or even a dehumidifier could make a difference.
Can I go on Budget Billing at any time?
Yes, you may begin the plan anytime. However, if you have a past due balance, payment arrangements may be required.
Are there any other important requirements?
Since Budget Billing is a service to you, we appreciate prompt payment. If your monthly bills are not paid on time, you may incur late payment charges, and it may become necessary to remove you from the plan.
Do you offer any other programs that could make paying my energy bills easier?
Automatic Payment deducts your monthly payment directly from your checking or savings account, and is very popular with Budget Billing customers. By combining the two programs, you have about the same payment made automatically at the same time of every month.
WithÂ Kubra EZ-Pay, you can pay your UPPCO bill with your credit card, pinless debit card or checking account.

SimpleLogin works very well with Proton Mail, and it's great that this is now included in certain paid subscriptions, however there are some opportunities for a more seamless integration in the Proton Mail apps (Web and Mobile), in particular: 
Receiving emails: 
Option to show actual email address as sender instead of reverse-alias  under "From" (i.e. use "X-Simplelogin-Envelope-From" email header where enabled instead of "From").
Sending emails: 
Option to select email alias as sender under "From" (in the same way as "real" addresses/mailboxes) and then use actual email addresses (rather than the reverse-aliases) under "To", and have Proton Mail automatically use (and generate if not yet created) the reverse-alias addresses for each of the recipients. 
Managing aliases: 
Option to create a new alias from Proton Mail (i.e. under "Manage my addresses").
Essentially, the idea would be that when using the Proton Mail apps, one could use an email alias in exactly the same way as a "real" email address/mailbox, and have Proton Mail handle all the reverse-alias generation/substitution transparently to the end-user (at first glance, there  would ideally still be some way of indicating that addresses have been substituted, perhaps with an icon next to the address that when clicked will show the reverse-alias that is actually used to send the email).

Hello!
Please speed up the development of your android application. Your iOS app has features that are not in the Android app. It just seems like a shame. Could you please speed up adding anti-tracking features (tracker blocking and picture uploads with IP hiding) to the android app as well? It would also be desirable to add the toolbar customization feature as well.
Please note that all these features are already available in iOS application, while there are practically no innovations in Android application. This is just a shame and shame for such a huge company.

Please allow the app to perform offline operations (read any and all inbox email, delete, write and send emails), which will be queued for syncing whenever online. Same for calendar events. 
As it is now, any email sending/deleting, calendar event creation etc will FAIL if the phone happens to be disconnecting from wifi, changing networks or any of the thousands of possibilities of a mobile device moving around at all times. Any other Android email client knows to queue these tasks offline (ie, gmail OUTBOX folder), and sync them with the server at any available time it manages to connect, or keep trying until it does (and not throwing a FAILED error, trashing all the text you wrote).

Hello Outlook.com now is accepting to choose what alias can be used to login on account to improve security.
Why Proton mail dont do the same thing? with this we are protected from botnets(credential stuffing or brute force), because we can create a alias and dont share the username with anyone.
Thanks

Hellove!
Yesterday I used Google Contacts (and/or the default Huawei contacts) app on my Android phone. 
Tomorrow, I will use the secure and lovely Proton Contacts app for Android (and possibly iOS - there are probably iOS users who would want this, too). 
From this Proton Contacts app, I will also be able to do my regular calls, browse call logs, see favourite contacts and groups for contacts, and utilize a search function for it all. 
Please strongly consider making this tomorrow today, Proton Team <3 
Thank you!

2FA / MFA should be the accepted standard for improved security by now?! Even Amazon supports OTP by Yubikey with YubiAuthenticator. Any Phone based OTP or 2FA App is inherently unpleasant. So why not support hardware tokens or OTP without the App? I don't quite see the point of being forced to use the App to activate 2FA. Unless this has marketing reasons - but come on we're talking security here - that's why we love ProtonMail. Pretty please with sugar on top: Give us OTP and Yubikey support without the App. Thank You kindly.

Folder and label organization needs to improve. 
One should have the oportunity to at least sort alphabet and date added. When creating labels and folders, and when you have a lot of sub-folders it tends to get really messy and it's time consuming to try to organize this manually with drag and drop.

Can no longer upvote that one so I'm creating a new one, hoping at some point Proton will give an update on this. I switched from Google thinking "what could possibly be missing in the year of 2023 that would be considered basic functionality" and its this, turns out.

In the Protonmail mobile app, you can log in with multiple accounts at the same one, but only one of these accounts is allowed to be on the free plan, even if you have another paid account.
I understand the restriction when using only free accounts, but I already pay for my main account. I need to monitor two mailboxes of groups/organizations that I'm in. Both of them are on the free plan, which means I have to choose which one I add even though I pay for my main account.

I understand that you're not getting money by selling our data but Proton basic plan is so poor. For example, we can only add 3 folders. I wanted to switch from Gmail to Protonmail but even that is blocking me from doing so. I think, over time, when you add new features, some old features which were paid should come free to get more user base.

Currently on the web UI, the time of the email is positioned in the main list on the right, or top right in the preview of a selected email.
But ONLY when its today.  As soon as its yesterday or before, you only get the day.  You then have to click down arrow icon to show the full date and time.
Showing the date and time could be an optional feature, which would only mean the ability to set whether that down arrow is a default of down or up per user.
That would at least mean the preview of the email is complete without extra clicks.
This wouldn't solve the convenience of seeing the times in the list view though - although again maybe just having the choice of format would be easy enough.
When looking through email alerts, the timing is often very important, and being able to glance at all the emails and see the times is very useful for a techie looking at technical alerts.
I hope others can see the benefit of this - I'm not one for votes making something important, but if this needs votes, then please vote for it!

Our banknotes are manufactured in Asia by a nation, have all the security features and are impossible to differentiate from a real one. Prices depend on the quantity but are not cheap, are perfect bills of the highest quality, not homemade prints. Sample packs available, click here.
Available from Asia only,Only Swiss francs are sent directly from Asia. Shipping is totally secure.
We offer sample packages of various denominations, CLICK HERE. The cheapest sample at special price cost $250 including DHL/UPS express shipping, it includes 5 bills of 20, 5 bills of 50 and 5 bills of 100, and it's the best possible price considering that shipping only costs between â¬60 and â¬110 depending on the country (check DHL.be/fr). We do not offer free samples or smaller packages, we have offered them in the past and only attracted curious  and most of them did not arrive in regular mail. Stealth packing and express shipping is essential for the shipment to arrive without problems, and that is expensive and requires work. The sample pack is sent only once per address/person, is an special price for the first time only. Our bills are quite expensive even in Asia where are manufactured, are not homemade prints. 


It is the highest quality possible. We in France use all the 200 and 500 bills (which are not for sale) and most of the 100, we generally spend them in the casino for chips, play a little and cashout. Obviously we can't go daily and change thousands of euros without attracting attention and generating some risk, that's why we sell here. We spend as much as we can and sell the rest here, in addition to the other denominations and other currencies that can only be exchanged up to 3000 euro in exchange offices, that's why we only have the option to sell them here. Are perfect banknotes but there are risks, repeating serial numbers, or drawing too much attention and cause an advanced analysis of the microprints are the main risks. Are perfect bills 1:1 pass even in banks, but if they do an advanced analysis of microprints they could detect them at some point, so you should spend them safely little by little and without attracting attention. You can't just go to the bank and deposit 100K, you have to do it little by little , so if are detected at some point in the future they will not be able to trace it back to you. It will never be detected with conventional methods, it passes all tests, infrared, pen,  even in advanced bill counters, we test each bill on a bill counter with an advanced infrared detector before shipping.

We are the only honest seller of high quality bills, we accept any CLEARNET bitcoin Escrow, the escrow hold your money until you receive the package and release the payment, if you dont receive the notes, you receive a full refund from escrow, it's simple, zero risk. 
No. We have posted several videos on our web and will post more in the future. They are videos recorded carefully trying not to reveal anything personal, deleting the metadata and uploading them from secure IP because is not possible to upload them from TOR. I think they prove without a doubt that we are real and that our product is the highest quality that pass even bill counters with fake money detectors. If it's not enough just buy elsewhere, we do not send personalized videos or photos to anyone. We have done it in the past and 95% are curious people without real interest that waste our time for nothing. 

 We have found that some comics with embossed prints and artistic holograms on the outside are the safest way to send it because the bills hide very well under the xrays among the rest of the paper. We have been perfecting it over time using amazon logo packaging to avoid problems and make the package go unnoticed. In the beginning we used envelopes and the postal service and many of the packages never arrived, others were opened by customs but that has never happened sending the bills between the pages of comics with amazon packaging. It's  totally safe.  We also ship to lockers, UPS access points, DHL service points etc. We have 5% of old generation bills of USD, Euros and GBP that are randomly shipped, are also perfect bills 1:1, if you do not want them and only want the new series, please inform us in your order. 
Yes, We accept any CLEARNET bitcoin Escrow, the escrow hold your money until you receive the package and release the payment, if you dont receive the notes, you receive a full refund from escrow, it's simple, zero risk. 
No. We don't do deals face to face for security reasons, this is more punishable than drugs, I don't know if you are a cop and I don't want to stay 15 years in the shadows. We accept escrow to eliminate any risk, the escrow guarantees that you will receive the product or we refund you the money and we accept any bitcoin escrow. And our shipping is totally secure so there is no risk to either party. There are no exceptions.
We accept Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin, Tron etc or any CLEARNET bitcoin Escrow. Only cryptocurrencies are accepted, there are no exceptions. You can contact us by email to place your order.
No. Due to the nature of our business and the risks with the authorities only Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin etc) and Bitcoin Escrows are accepted. 
We delete your information after each shipment and the shipment is totally secure. Your personal information is not at risk. However for more peace of mind we can ship to UPS access points, DHL service points or Lockers (in some countries) if you prefer. This way we only need the city, postal code and a name for shipping. In some countries we can send to lockers and only need a phone number to receive the SMS with code, this phone number can be hired at 5sim.net so everything would be anonymous for you. 
You can find our  PGP Key here. Try to use it if you know how to use it.

Wendy Williamsâ family wants her released from the facility where she is currently receiving treatment for frontotemporal dementia and aphasia.
âI know that she is stuck and we are trying to unstick her. Her family is here and she doesnât need a facility. We are here to take care of her,â Wendyâs brother, Tommy Williams, exclusively tells Us Weekly. âAll I want for her is freedom. We have a father who would love to see her.â

Williamsâ dementia and aphasia diagnoses were revealed in a Thursday, February 22, press release. The update came ahead of the Saturday, February 24, premiere of the four-part Lifetime documentary Where Is Wendy Williams?
The docuseries aired despite a lawsuit filed by Wendyâs guardian against A&E Television Networks. In court documents obtained by Us on Thursday, an individual named Sabrina Morrisey requested a temporary restraining order and claimed she was acting in her capacity as temporary guardian of W.W.H., presumed to be Wendy Williams Hunter. A judge ruled on Friday, February 23, that the documentary could air as planned despite the ongoing lawsuit.

The former talk show host, 59, was placed under financial guardianship in May 2022 after her bank Wells Fargo alleged that she seemed to be the victim of financial exploitation. The decision came three months after it was announced that Wendy would take a hiatus from season 13 of her titular talk show.
Amid the conservatorship drama, Tommy tells Us itâs been âextremely difficultâ for his family.
âWeâre dealing with unknowns,â he says. âWe just want to be able to check in with her. I would fly up there [to New York], but where do I go? No one knows anything.â
To make matters worse, Tommy notes that communication between the TV host and her siblings is sporadic.
âWe canât communicate unless someone patches us through,â he reveals. âWe wait for calls. I wait for calls from Wendy or my sister or whoever she can get to first and we can all hop on. When she makes that phone call [to us], weâre committed to listening and sharing for the moment.â
The concerned brother adds that it âseems like foreverâ since heâs seen Wendy.
âItâs because of the people who she is around. You canât leave. Youâre there as part of a program,â he says. âItâs the one thing that is holding her and keeping her from communicating, traveling and doing all the things she likes to do.â
While Tommy doesnât appear in Where Is Wendy Williams?, other members of Wendyâs family participated, including her sister, Wanda Williams, and her son, Kevin Hunter Jr.
During the docuseries, Kevin, 23, recalled his momâs medical team stating that Wendyâs drinking âwas starting to affect her headspace and her brain.â
He added: âSo, I think they said it was alcohol-induced dementia.â
Tommy acknowledges that there was ânaturally some concernâ among Wendyâs family members about her drinking habits.
âIt was obvious about her drinking. She was alone and her mental state, having been divorced and losing her mother and liquor, it was not a good mix,â he says, referring to Wendyâs 2020 split from ex-husband Kevin Hunter Sr. and the death of her mom, Shirley Williams, that same year. âShe was very upset about losing her mother and very sad.â
Despite Wendyâs challenges, Tommy says her family can âfigure it out and get her whatever she needs.â
Wendy broke her silence on her recent diagnosis in a Friday statement to Us.

âI want to say I have immense gratitude for the love and kind words I have received after sharing my diagnosis of Aphasia and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD),â she said. âLet me say, wow! Your response has been overwhelming.â
The beloved TV personality added that she needs âpersonal space and peace to thriveâ but told fans that their âpositivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.â

	Things are heating up in Metropolis, as DC Studios co-head James Gunn has announced he is writing a new feature film about Superman. In step with the new project, Gunn has also revealed that Henry Cavill will not return as the hero.

	“Peter & I have a DC slate ready to go, which we couldn’t be more over-the-moon about; we’ll be able to share some exciting information about our first projects at the beginning of the new year,” the director-turned-label-chief tweeted Wednesday evening.

	“Among those on the slate is Superman. In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill. But we just had a great meeting with Henry and we’re big fans and we talked about a number of exciting possibilities to work together in the future.” 

	














	Sources close to DC told Variety that Gunn, his co-president Peter Safran and Cavill met recently and are all energized to find something in the comic book universe for Cavill to tackle. 



	Cavill confirmed the he would not be reprising the role of Superman in a statement shared on Instagram.

	“It’s sad news, everyone. I will, after all, not be returning as Superman. After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn’t the easiest, but that’s life,” Cavill wrote. “I respect that James and Peter have a universe to build. I wish them and all involved with the new universe the best of luck, and the happiest of fortunes.” 
A post shared by Henry Cavill (@henrycavill)

	Gunn has been at work on the new Superman story for some time, insiders say. The script will focus on the character’s life as a cub reporter in the fictional city of Metropolis. Audiences will encounter him meeting key characters, like colleague Lois Lane, insiders added. Additionally, Variety sources said the new Gunn project will not replace the previously announced J.J. Abrams-Ta-Nehisi Coates Superman concept (which is still in active development).  

	Cavill isn’t the only star from the last DC era to sit down with Gunn and Safran. Ben Affleck — who has played Batman in numerous films from the label — recently met with the pair to specifically discuss the prospect of directing an upcoming DC feature, individuals familiar with those talks said. 

	The Superman news comes after a week of headlines following Warner Bros. decision to not move forward with a new “Wonder Woman” movie with director Patty Jenkins. On Tuesday, Jenkins tweeted a lengthy statement saying she was “was open to considering anything asked of me” in regards to a potential third project, which was scrapped. Shortly after, Gunn responded with support, saying to Jenkins on Twitter, “I can attest that all of Peter and my interactions with you were only pleasant and professional.”

	










	As Gunn stated Monday, more details on the reimagined DC Universe are expected to come in January.

Despite its popularity among drug dealers on the dark web or hackers demanding hefty ransoms to unlock their victims' computers, Bitcoin has never been too hard to trace for feds and cops chasing supposedly anonymous cybercriminals on the internet. That's why more tech-savvy criminals use cryptocurrencies like Monero, which promise more anonymity.
As criminals start to embrace new technologies, the cops are following suit. The United States Internal Revenue Service is now offering up to $625,000 for new tools to track down criminals using the privacy-focused Monero cryptocurrency and new blockchain technology such as the Bitcoin Lightning Network
The IRS published a request for proposals last week, with a deadline for September 16.
"There are limited investigative resources for tracing transactions involving privacy cryptocurrency coins such as Monero, Layer 2 network protocol transactions such as Lightning Labs, or other off-chain transactions that provide privacy to illicit actors," the IRS wrote.
The agency is looking for new solutions to help its IRS-Criminal Investigations agents trace transactions made with Monero or other privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, as well as on the Lightning network. The IRS wants to be able to see these tools' algorithms and source code to integrate them into their existing solutions, andâideallyâminimize the involvement of external vendors, according to the request for proposals.
"We are looking for solutions which provide the best results for tracing obfuscated cryptocurrency transactions using Monero and/or Lightning," the IRS wrote.
The IRS plans to pay whoever comes up with a solution that fits its requirements $500,000 in a first phase of software development and proof of concept that will last eight months, and an additional $125,000 for a second phase of testing and initial deployment that will last 120 days. The agency isn't planning to pick only one proposal, as it plans to spend around $1 million "in FY20 [fiscal year 2020] funding across all solutions."
The developers who win the contract will work closely with IRS agents to develop the technology, which the developers will be able to offer elsewhere as well, as the IRS "does not intend to request retention of any intellectual property," but just the chance to continue using the solutions with a "non-exclusive perpetual royalty-free license to any source code developed with this funding," according to the document.
âPrivacy coins continue to be a challenge to law enforcement due to their increased anonymity and specific technological enhancements.â an IRS spokesperson said in an emailed statement. âCurrently, there are limited investigative resources for tracing transactions involving privacy cryptocurrency coins such as Monero, Layer 2 network protocol transactions such as Lightning Labs, or other off-chain transactions that provide privacy to illicit actors. The pilot will look to leverage the knowledge of public/private sector and academia to address these specific challenges.â
There are several companies that offer cryptocurrency tracing technologies, such as Chainalysis, CipherTrace, and Neutrino, a startup that was acquired by Coinbase.

Our broadband satisfaction survey reveals that customers of the biggest providers aren't satisfied with the broadband service they receive. Yet when we surveyed more than 8,000 broadband customers, we found that only around half had ever switched.
So we asked those who had switched what it was that enticed them to take the plunge. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people were most likely to switch when they were offered a better deal than the one they had been on. But this was only the case for around a quarter of people. Read on to discover the other reasons for moving to a new supplier.



Use our overview of the best (and worst) broadband providers of 2019 to find one that ticks all of your boxes.
Nearly a quarter of those who had switched did so because they found a better deal with a new provider. With contract prices typically going up by around 20% at the end of an introductory period, it's not too surprising that many customers are on the hunt for a cheaper tariff.



Customers departing Zen Internet were most likely to switch away for this reason: 40% of those who had left the provider said it was because they'd found a better deal elsewhere.



EE, TalkTalk and Post Office were the providers most likely to benefit here. Around four in ten of those who had switched to these three providers had done so because better deals were on offer.



If you've been with your provider for a long period, you're likely to be paying more than people who have switched regularly. Compare broadband in your area with Which? Switch Broadband to find the best deals where you live and see how much you could save.



18% of switchers moved providers after experiencing poor customer service. This number doubles for TalkTalk customers, with 37% of those who ditched their provider doing so because of customer service issues.



But TalkTalk wasn't the only one that received poor ratings for customer service in our survey. Our broadband provider reviews reveal how it stacked up against the other biggest providers in the UK.



Zen Internet was the provider most likely to benefit from people growing of customer service issues - 37% of those who switched had moved for this reason. Around 25% of those switching to SSE and Utility Warehouse had also ditched past providers due to disappointing customer service.



Price hikes drove 12% of respondents away from their provider, although the figure rose to 18% for those quitting BT, and 20% for ex-Sky customers.



If your provider announces that it's putting prices up, you have the right to switch - even if you're still within the minimum terms of your contract.



If you're happy with your provider, there's another way you can avoid price rises: haggling. This can sound daunting, but the majority of those who try negotiating with their provider are successful - and most say it's easy too. For a step-by-step guide on how to do it, read our tips on how to haggle for the best broadband deal.
This was the reason 9% of respondents switched, although it was much more of an issue for customers leaving Post Office Broadband: 19% of those who departed did so due to slow speeds.



Where do customers with sluggish broadband go? Virgin Media, usually, as 32% of those who had switched to the provider said they'd done so seeking faster speeds.



Virgin Media is the only major provider with its own cable network, which means it's able to offer ultrafast speeds in more locations than other providers, where speeds of 100Mbps or greater are limited to certain parts of the country. Do you really need speeds this high? Read our guide on broadband speeds to find out.



Connection problems drove 7% of respondents away from their provider, although this figure doubled for customers leaving Vodafone and EE.



In April, Ofcom introduced automatic compensation to help those that suffer long internet outages. If your connection isn't fixed within two working days, you will receive Â£8-a-day compensation paid as a refund on your next bill if your provider is signed up to the voluntary scheme.



To check whether your connection problems are down to a large-scale outage, use our round-up of broadband provider contacts.

If you need help using Tor you can contact WikiLeaks for assistance in setting it up using our simple webchat available at: https://wikileaks.org/talk
If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use our secured webchat available at http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion
We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.
Tor is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.
In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.
If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called Tails. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.
Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. 
If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please contact us. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.
If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use Tails to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.
If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection â it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.
If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection â it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.
If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.
If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.
In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.
If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.
If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at https://www.couragefound.org.
WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.
The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our Tor tab for more information.) We also advise you to read our tips for sources before submitting.
If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. Contact us to discuss how to proceed.


The Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms is a compendium of terminology used by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The Wikileaks edition corresponds to the September 17, 2007 US DoD edition.
It sets forth standard US military and associated terminology to encompass the joint activity of the Armed Forces of the United States in both US joint and allied joint operations, as well as to encompass the DoD as a whole. These military and associated terms, together with their definitions, constitute approved DOD terminology for general use by all components of the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense, by DoD Directive 5025.12, 23 August 1989, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology, has directed its use throughout the Department of Defense to ensure standardization of military and associated terminology.

M. Tullio Cicerone, l'uomo che sarebbe diventato l'esempio del travaglio della sua epoca e l'autore letterario piÃ¹ importante e influente di questa epoca che non a caso Ã¨ detta ciceroniana, nacque nel 106 a.C., nel territorio tra Sora ed Arpino. Discendente di una famiglia agiata equestre, fu educato a Roma, dove interruppe brevemente gli studi solo per partecipare alla guerra civile. ColtivÃ² tutte le discipline che riteneva idonee per un buon oratore e che saranno al centro del suo De oratore: studio' giurisprudenza con i due Scevola, l'augure e il pontefice; filosofia con lo stoico Diodoto e l'academico Filone di Larissa; eloquenza con Apollonio Molone di Rodi. Si dedicÃ² anche alla poesia si tenne, infatti, in contatto con la poesia sviluppatosi nel circolo di Lutazio Catulo che era innovativa in campo stilistico e metrico proprio come lui.

The biggest Congressional scandal of the digital age: Politicians aren't putting public docs on the Net, and no one seems to care.
A political consultant walks into a bar in Washington, DC, and notices that the TV is playing a closed-captioned news broadcast. In one of those moments that give DC its wonkish tang, he has an inspiration: Why not use technology to make Congress more accessible to the public?
So, in April 1999, Philip Angell, then head of corporate communications for Monsanto, started thinking about congressional hearings - the year-round pageant of experts, lawyers, government officials, lobbyists, academics, and miscellaneous citizen-advocates who testify before House and Senate committees. Although some hearings are empty exercises in showboating, the bulk are noteworthy, particularly those that involve pending legislation, appropriations, nominations, and oversight of government agencies. Angell knew it was often difficult to attend the hearings that matter: The committee rooms are not large; most congressional leaders couldn't care less about making life easier for spectators; and flocks of lobbyists and reporters descend upon the meatiest sessions, sometimes paying line-standers to reserve spots. C-Span airs a limited number of hearings - some live, some after the fact. And, upholding bureaucratic tradition, the committees and subcommittees themselves don't release printed transcripts for many months. Even though most hearings are officially "public," it's not easy for citizens to tap in. Surely, Angell thought, technology could open some doors.
He was right. This June, Angell launched HearingRoom.com (www.hearingroom.com), a Web site that uses voice recognition technology to deliver real-time streaming text and audio of congressional hearings. In the 14 months since his brainstorm, he accomplished what Congress has not even bothered to try. But Angell is a businessman, not a public policy do-gooder; he intends to make a buck. In fact, he's estimating revenue of $3 million in the first year alone. A subscription to his service costs $1,000 to $15,000 a year - hardly a for-the-people price. Naturally, his first two dozen customers are lobbyists, corporations, and media organizations. The average political junkie is still locked out.
Angell's venture underscores a profound failure of Congress. Why is it that the powers that be on Capitol Hill - the people who write our laws and who make up what is supposed to be the federal government's most accessible arm - have not enthusiastically embraced the Internet and put their day-to-day work online? Angell created a relatively simple operation using off-the-shelf tools and a modest budget. He drew on existing voice-rec technology - Lernout & Hauspie's Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional software. He raised about $850,000 in seed money - a tiny sum compared with congressional appropriations. And he easily obtained permission to wire Senate and House committee rooms with audio feed lines. None of this was beyond Congress' means, but all of it was light-years beyond its imagination.
Newt Gingrich vowed to unlock "the entire flow of information," for free. Six years later, it's yours - for $1,000 to $15,000 a year.

"Congress could do this if it wanted, and there is nothing standing in the way," says Angell, who could be put out of business tomorrow if legislators flip the right switches. But that is unlikely to happen, despite the fact that Congress promised to get wired six years ago.
Days after the Republicans snatched control of the House of Representatives in 1994, Newt Gingrich, the speaker-to-be, declared he would push Congress into the information age. Gingrich saw himself as a revolutionary poised to remake the government and renew American society. He pledged to create a system that would allow the entire country to have electronic access to congressional documents. With typically melodramatic flair, he promised to change "the entire flow of information and the entire quality of knowledge in the country."
There was certainly room for improvement on the Hill. At the time, only a few congressional documents - such as the daily Congressional Record and the original text of selected bills - were available online. Gingrich knew that Congress could do much more. Announcing that he would recruit futurist Alvin Toffler and various high tech firms, he vowed that "we will change the rules of the House to require that all documents ... be filed electronically ... so that information is available to every citizen in the country at the same moment it is available to the highest-paid Washington lobbyist." It was a fresh and forward-looking plan.
Unfortunately, it didn't go very far. Lobbyists still have better access than any plugged-in commoner. Members of Congress, who in '94 were amazingly un-wired as a group, have learned to make use of the Net, but mostly in the interest of campaigning, managing PR, or scoring partisan political points. Everyone remembers how quickly the House Judiciary Committee posted Kenneth Starr's salacious report on the Monica Lewinsky mess and other impeachment-related documents, many of which embarrassed Bill Clinton. And every member of Congress now has a self-glorifying Web site. Even so, much of Congress' basic work cannot be accessed on the Net. And these days, there is little rah-rah talk on the Hill about changing that.
For several years, public-access advocates have been grumbling about this unfulfilled promise. Leading the pack is Gary Ruskin, the 35-year-old director of the Congressional Accountability Project, an organization founded by Ralph Nader. Sitting in his dark Dupont Circle office beneath soot-stained windows and tall, unsteady stacks of old newspapers and books, Ruskin ticks off a list of vital information that Congress has failed to post on the Web. A top item: working drafts of legislation, the new versions of bills that emerge as they crawl through subcommittees and committees. You won't find these updates posted on Thomas, the main congressional Web site (thomas.loc.gov). This material is often available in hard copy to the lobbyists who prowl the halls of Congress. But these working versions are rarely obtainable in electronic form. No committee chair has made this a priority, so if you're unable to visit Capitol Hill and find a cooperative aide, you're out of luck.

"I have yet to meet a member of Congress who supports placing this stuff online," Ruskin says. "There are reasons why members might want to keep bills secret or quiet sometimes. They can hope things like favors done for contributors or boondoggles or waste are not discovered easily. But there's a basic question here: How can citizens be expected to petition their Congress knowledgeably without access to the relevant legislative documents?"
Thomas lacks mountains of other useful information, including Congressional Research Service reports, which are not routinely posted. The CRS, a nonpartisan, highly regarded research outfit housed in the Library of Congress, has published roughly 3,000 studies on a variety of subjects - tritium production, mastectomies, food safety, leaking underground storage tanks, global warming, and the Internet, to name a few. You can obtain a copy of an individual CRS report by submitting a written request to a congressional office - a cumbersome process - or you can buy one from a commercial service that collects this material. All of these reports could be placed online easily and affordably. Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader from South Dakota, for instance, has posted several hundred CRS reports on his Web site. The CRS reports are also available at a Congress-only intranet. But this site isn't open to the public, and Congress and the CRS have resisted calls to open it up.
Congress also hasn't established a searchable database of votes. On the Thomas site, it's nearly impossible to find a lawmaker's voting record on a given issue unless you know the roll-call numbers of the relevant votes. Nor does the site list committee and subcommittee votes. (Often the most important votes occur in committee, not on the House or Senate floor.) "You can get a senator's favorite recipe on his Web site, but you can't search how he voted," Ruskin says. "None of this is rocket science. A perfectly competent 12-year-old could write this database."
Congress also fails to post the financial disclosure statements of its members. These annual forms, which contain details about personal financial holdings, are available for inspection at the public information offices of the House and Senate. The Center for Responsive Politics (www.opensecrets.com), a public interest group based in Washington, scans and posts the records, but these usually don't appear until weeks after they are filed. (See "By the People, For the People," page 232.)
"You can get a senator's favorite recipe on his Web site," says public-access advocate Gary Ruskin. "But you can't search how he voted."
Several times a year, lobbyists are required to register with Congress and reveal what legislation they're attempting to influence. Congress doesn't post these reports either, which is too bad: They show how highpowered interests are working to shape laws. CRP inputs this information and posts it, but again months go by before it becomes available. Other basic documents, such as gift disclosures and expense reports, can be read on paper if you visit or contact the appropriate congressional office, but you won't find them online.
Byron Tau
Julian Chokkattu
David Nield
Kate Knibbs
"Why shouldn't Congress post the material as it comes in?" asks Larry Makinson, executive director of the CRP. "There's an institutional inertia that is breathtaking to behold."
Public interest groups are pressuring politicians to release information electronically in a timely manner. Two years ago, the DC-based groups Center for Democracy and Technology and OMB Watch issued a 10 Most Wanted list of government documents that should be on the Web but aren't. The list targeted several congressional items - CRS reports, hearing transcripts, and a searchable database of votes.
Librarians and researchers are also pressing for more e-access. "Hearing transcripts, which include prepared testimony and various attachments, are one of the most heavily used federal documents," says Lynne Bradley, director of the office of government relations at the American Library Association in DC. "It's outrageous they're not all electronically available."
Few in Congress share the outrage. John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, have introduced bipartisan legislation that would place CRS reports online and compel the Senate to post lobbyist records and senators' travel and expense records. A broad coalition supported the bill when it was put in the hopper in February 1999, including Common Cause, the League of Women Voters, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the National Association of Manufacturers, IBM, America Online, Netscape, and Intel. But the legislation has stalled in the Senate Rules Committee. "It just sits there," says McCain.
In the House, Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut, and David Price, a Democrat from North Carolina, have introduced legislation to post CRS reports. This measure too is going nowhere fast.
Congress is not the only government body slow to adapt to the Net. The 10 Most Wanted list also included the State Department's daily briefing book, the EPA's pesticide safety database, legal briefs from the Justice Department, and the opinions of federal district and appeals courts. (Most appeals courts make opinions available electronically, though not always on their own Web sites. Most federal district courts do not. Federal law requires courts to make opinions publicly available, but it does not dictate the means by which they do so. In other words, paper is fine.) Three of the items from the 1998 list have become electronically available in the past two years: Supreme Court decisions; PTO Today, the official gazette of the US Patent and Trademark Office; and the Department of Interior's endangered-species recovery plans. The stuffy, tradition-bound Supreme Court unveiled a Web site in April. (The Supreme Court of Mongolia had a site up before the US Supreme Court.) In another case of judicial inertia, the Committee on Financial Disclosures - which manages the federal courts - last year tried to block the Web site APBnews.com from posting the financial disclosure reports filed by all 1,600 federal judges, claiming this would violate the privacy of judges and create security risks for the bench-tenders. These are public documents, so it should have been a no-brainer, but APBnews endured several months of legal wrangling before it won the fight.

Not all the news is bad: A few of the 20,000-plus government Web sites have made real progress in capturing the potential of IT, and the Clinton administration came on strong in its waning months. Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst for CDT, applauds the EPA for posting its Toxics Release Inventory database (www.epa.gov/tri), which visitors can use to determine whether toxic chemicals are being used, transported, or released in their area. He also commends the State Department for quickly putting up the transcripts and audio feeds of its daily briefings (secretary.state.gov/www/briefings), which are carefully read around the world by journalists, government officials, and others who monitor every hiccup in US foreign policy. The House Science Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee occasionally webcast their hearings, and other congressional committees seem ready to follow suit. The Federal Elections Commission maintains an easy-to-use site (www.fec.gov) that supplies extensive information on where politicians get their campaign funds.
On the 2000 campaign trail, Al Gore talked about doing a lot more, calling for the creation of a new "e-government" that would place nearly every federal government service online by 2003. Gore noted that citizens should be able to check their Social Security benefits, look up the status of a student loan, and investigate the purity of their local drinking water on the Net. Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Fred Thompson, a Republican from Tennessee, have pushed a similar e-government initiative in the Senate.
Earlier this year, the Clinton White House spent $600,000 over seven months to redesign its Web site (www.whitehouse.gov). The site allows citizens to obtain much of the material (speeches, press briefings, reports, fact sheets) that the White House churns out. It also lets you reserve a campsite in a national forest, file a consumer fraud complaint, review crash results for new automobiles, and apply for financial aid for college. When the redesign was made public, President Clinton announced that a team led by Eric Brewer - cofounder and chief scientist at Inktomi - was busy creating a one-stop site (www. firstgov.gov) for searching all of the federal government documents available online. The impressive goal, which is supposed to be reached sometime this fall, is a site that could handle at least 100 million daily searches, looking through half a billion documents in less than one-quarter of a second.
None of these changes will necessarily compel congressional slowpokes to get with the program. Not to mention the fact that if Congress doesn't digitize its own information, its documents will remain beyond the reach of any one-stop government site. FirstGov, the elections commission's site, and the proposals for e-government vividly demonstrate that Congress lags far behind the other branches of government. These efforts underscore that the obstacles to an e-Congress are not technical ones. They are not cost-driven. It's a matter of will, which is precisely what Congress seems to lack.
The obstacles are not price-driven, or technical. FirstGov promises to search half a billion documents in less than a quarter of a second.

After Gingrich sounded off in 1994, he assigned the task of Netifying Congress to Republican representatives Bill Thomas, the incoming chair of the House Oversight Committee fromCalifornia, and Vernon Ehlers, a physicist who helped get the Michigan legislature online when he served there in the '80s and early '90s. Ehlers moved quickly. By the time Gingrich assumed the speakership in early 1995, Ehlers saw to it that all new bills, committee reports related to these bills, scheduling information, and the US Code (the massive compendium of federal laws) were obtainable free online. Ehlers also oversaw a two-year project to centralize and modernize the House computer system. At the same time, the Library of Congress continued to develop Thomas as a consumer-oriented gateway to the House and Senate computer systems. "Never before in history has the public had such opportunity to be knowledgeable about public officials," Ehlers boasts now.
Gingrich, too, is proud of his effort to computerize Congress, though he concedes it did not proceed as far as it could have. "We moved a fair distance," he says, "but then got bogged down in the act of governing." So how much longer before everything printed is also available online? Don't hold your breath, he counsels. Gingrich believes Congress needs a high-powered task force to fully prod the body into the information age, and that will take some young members making a fuss. Yet the former Speaker still revs up quickly, envisioning a "congressional information service" that brings all the "real-time activities and archived activities" into people's homes via the Internet. "It could be the most profound change since Jefferson sold his library to Congress," he says. "Yet nobody is building that sort of architecture. And no one is introducing legislation to make it happen."
Ehlers gets defensive when challenged on this front. "We've put millions of pages up," he says. "Those complaining are not giving an accurate view of what is available proportionately." How about working drafts of legislation? "Well, that's a tough problem," he says. "I don't know if it's of any comfort to the public, but frequently we don't have written copies of bills. Most bills go through constant change and are kept in a staffer's desk until the final session." (To this, the Congressional Accountability Project's Ruskin counters that lobbyists on the Hill often are able to find printed versions of bills as the legislation proceeds.) As for committee hearings, Ehlers says that it's the committee chairs who determine what happens to the transcripts. "Chairmen can decide whether or not to devote staff" to digitizing and posting transcripts, he says. They rarely do.
Lobbyist disclosure reports? "I know of no policy that would prevent their posting," Ehlers says. True, but there's no policy that leads to their posting, either. CRS reports? Some are, Ehlers asserts, the property of the senators and representatives who order them. It's up to these lawmakers to decide whether they should be released. So automatic posting of those is out of the question. (Ehlers, though, has proposed a compromise that would result in a limited number of CRS reports being made electronically available.)

And what about a searchable database of voting records? "Sure, there could be such a thing. But it's a question of resources. As one of our members put it to me, the problem is that the media is lazy and wants us to do their work for them. To what extent do we have a responsibility to collate information and do databases, when we provide the raw data? It would be a lot of work to organize. So many votes are hard to explain."
The two committees responsible for managing Congress - the House Committee on Administration and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee - share this attitude. Asked whether Congress is lagging, Jason Poblete, the press secretary of the House committee, blasts the detractors: "There are constant critics of the House, and they can find stuff to criticize, but they take no note that half the stuff online was not online four years ago." Confronted with specifics about the still-sizable gaps, Poblete concedes that not all committees have moved to post hearing transcripts and working drafts of legislation. "We will look into that at some point," he says.
Tamara Somerville, staff director of the Senate Rules committee, also quickly shifts the blame to committee chairs: "The committees all operate separately. I don't know what they're doing." In other words, the rules committee is not concerned with the lack of action. In a plea for sympathy, Somerville notes that Congress has trouble competing with the private sector when it comes to finding and retaining computer specialists. "It took us one year to hire an information technology person for our own committee Web page," she says with a sigh. Regarding the posting of lobbyist reports, Somerville says, "I can't recall that ever being discussed. We deal with so much every day. We're just so busy." Clearly, making Congress as compatible as possible with the Internet is not at the top of anyone's to-do list. It's barely a topic of conversation.
The Gingrich promise has been broken. What could be behind the general reluctance of Congress to place all of its public material within keyboard reach of citizens across the country? Could it be that members of Congress want to control information about themselves and don't want to be scrutinized?
"Exactly!" Senator McCain confirms. "All the information we have about what we do should be on the Web. I don't understand the opposition entirely myself. Part of it is an institutional bias. Part is business-as-usual thinking. I have a few allies, but most senators don't pay a lot of attention to this."
Could it be that members of Congress want to control information about themselves and don't want to be scrutinized? "Exactly!" says McCain.
Ultimately, the reason for Congress' slow walk is not difficult to fathom: The people running the place are not visionaries looking to change the power dynamic between politicians and citizens. As Larry Makinson of the Center for Responsive Politics says, "Newt wanted to put everything up on the Web, except what would inconvenience members of Congress."

Congress should use the Internet, Ruskin argues, to "allow citizens to impact bills while they are in process." Yet Congress is not eager to arm the people with digital information. "It's low on people's radar screens," says a congressional aide sympathetic to the critics. "Talking about government documents and the Internet doesn't grab headlines like saving Social Security or going to war against Serbia. Few people here care a lot about this."
Arguably, it is Congress' responsibility to exploit technological advances that boost citizen involvement in lawmaking and strengthen the bond between those who govern and those who are governed. But this congressional aide states a sad fact: "Unless there is a lot of public interest, there will not be any momentum to move things along."
True, there may not be a widespread popular clamor for an e-Congress. But there was no mass movement for television access to Congress before C-Span began broadcasting congressional proceedings in 1979. Now, C-Span is considered an essential component of the media-age democracy.
A commercial interest may be the driving force of an Net-accessible Congress. And HearingRoom.com's Philip Angell plans to expand his service to cover executive branch hearings, such as those conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the National Transportation Safety Board. Nonetheless, these agencies should post free digital versions of the hearings themselves, he says. Angell proudly notes that his dotcom, for a price, can "provide contemporaneous access to people all across the country - in thousands of cities, state and local governments, colleges, law schools, and libraries - to all who have an interest in Washington."
Angell figured out how the Internet could bridge the gap between Congress and the rest of us. It's shameful that none of the leaders of Congress are thinking about how to put him out of business.

wireguard
WireGuard® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.
If you'd like a general conceptual overview of what WireGuard is about, read onward here. You then may progress to installation and reading the quickstart instructions on how to use it.
If you're interested in the internal inner workings, you might be interested in the brief summary of the protocol, or go more in depth by reading the technical whitepaper, which goes into more detail on the protocol, cryptography, and fundamentals. If you intend to implement WireGuard for a new platform, please read the cross-platform notes.
WireGuard securely encapsulates IP packets over UDP. You add a WireGuard interface, configure it with your private key and your peers' public keys, and then you send packets across it. All issues of key distribution and pushed configurations are out of scope of WireGuard; these are issues much better left for other layers, lest we end up with the bloat of IKE or OpenVPN. In contrast, it more mimics the model of SSH and Mosh; both parties have each other's public keys, and then they're simply able to begin exchanging packets through the interface.
WireGuard works by adding a network interface (or multiple), like eth0 or wlan0, called wg0 (or wg1, wg2, wg3, etc). This network interface can then be configured normally using ifconfig(8) or ip-address(8), with routes for it added and removed using route(8) or ip-route(8), and so on with all the ordinary networking utilities. The specific WireGuard aspects of the interface are configured using the wg(8) tool. This interface acts as a tunnel interface.
WireGuard associates tunnel IP addresses with public keys and remote endpoints. When the interface sends a packet to a peer, it does the following:
When the interface receives a packet, this happens:
Behind the scenes there is much happening to provide proper privacy, authenticity, and perfect forward secrecy, using state-of-the-art cryptography.
At the heart of WireGuard is a concept called Cryptokey Routing, which works by associating public keys with a list of tunnel IP addresses that are allowed inside the tunnel. Each network interface has a private key and a list of peers. Each peer has a public key. Public keys are short and simple, and are used by peers to authenticate each other. They can be passed around for use in configuration files by any out-of-band method, similar to how one might send their SSH public key to a friend for access to a shell server.
For example, a server computer might have this configuration:
And a client computer might have this simpler configuration:
In the server configuration, each peer (a client) will be able to send packets to the network interface with a source IP matching his corresponding list of allowed IPs. For example, when a packet is received by the server from peer gN65BkIK..., after being decrypted and authenticated, if its source IP is 10.10.10.230, then it's allowed onto the interface; otherwise it's dropped.
In the server configuration, when the network interface wants to send a packet to a peer (a client), it looks at that packet's destination IP and compares it to each peer's list of allowed IPs to see which peer to send it to. For example, if the network interface is asked to send a packet with a destination IP of 10.10.10.230, it will encrypt it using the public key of peer gN65BkIK..., and then send it to that peer's most recent Internet endpoint.
In the client configuration, its single peer (the server) will be able to send packets to the network interface with any source IP (since 0.0.0.0/0 is a wildcard). For example, when a packet is received from peer HIgo9xNz..., if it decrypts and authenticates correctly, with any source IP, then it's allowed onto the interface; otherwise it's dropped.
In the client configuration, when the network interface wants to send a packet to its single peer (the server), it will encrypt packets for the single peer with any destination IP address (since 0.0.0.0/0 is a wildcard). For example, if the network interface is asked to send a packet with any destination IP, it will encrypt it using the public key of the single peer HIgo9xNz..., and then send it to the single peer's most recent Internet endpoint.
In other words, when sending packets, the list of allowed IPs behaves as a sort of routing table, and when receiving packets, the list of allowed IPs behaves as a sort of access control list.
This is what we call a Cryptokey Routing Table: the simple association of public keys and allowed IPs.
Any combination of IPv4 and IPv6 can be used, for any of the fields. WireGuard is fully capable of encapsulating one inside the other if necessary.
Because all packets sent on the WireGuard interface are encrypted and authenticated, and because there is such a tight coupling between the identity of a peer and the allowed IP address of a peer, system administrators do not need complicated firewall extensions, such as in the case of IPsec, but rather they can simply match on "is it from this IP? on this interface?", and be assured that it is a secure and authentic packet. This greatly simplifies network management and access control, and provides a great deal more assurance that your iptables rules are actually doing what you intended for them to do.
The client configuration contains an initial endpoint of its single peer (the server), so that it knows where to send encrypted data before it has received encrypted data. The server configuration doesn't have any initial endpoints of its peers (the clients). This is because the server discovers the endpoint of its peers by examining from where correctly authenticated data originates. If the server itself changes its own endpoint, and sends data to the clients, the clients will discover the new server endpoint and update the configuration just the same. Both client and server send encrypted data to the most recent IP endpoint for which they authentically decrypted data. Thus, there is full IP roaming on both ends.
WireGuard sends and receives encrypted packets using the network namespace in which the WireGuard interface was originally created. This means that you can create the WireGuard interface in your main network namespace, which has access to the Internet, and then move it into a network namespace belonging to a Docker container as that container's only interface. This ensures that the only possible way that container is able to access the network is through a secure encrypted WireGuard tunnel.
Consider glancing at the commands & quick start for a good idea of how WireGuard is used in practice. There is also a description of the protocol, cryptography, & key exchange, in addition to the technical whitepaper, which provides the most detail.
WireGuard is divided into several repositories hosted in the ZX2C4 Git Repository and elsewhere. Consult the project repository list.
If you're having trouble setting up WireGuard or using it, the best place to get help is the #wireguard IRC channel on Libera.Chat. We also discuss development tasks there and plan the future of the project.
Get involved in the WireGuard development discussion by joining the mailing list. This is where all development activities occur. Submit patches using git-send-email, similar to the style of LKML.
If you'd like to contact us privately for a particular reason, you may reach us at team@wireguard.com. Keep in mind, though, that "support" requests are much better suited for our IRC channel.

And an agency desperate.
This likely flew under the radar for many. It happened right after the Trump upset in November 2016. The establishment still hadn't regrouped, upper management at Google were still literally shaking. Julian Assange's theory seems the most plausible. Hillary could have indeed won, but every poll put her so far in front that there was no point in wasting further campaign millions.
2019-11-19: 19 November 2019. Mark this day.
This is the day that Sweden finally closed the 'preliminary' investigation into the allegations against Julian Assange, a case resumed on 1 September 2010, after being summarily closed once before by Stockholm prosecutor Eva FinnÃ©.
That's nine years, two months, and nineteen days to do what FinnÃ© accomplished in twelve hours.
Lives have been ruined - lives have been lost - during and because of this Swedish ordeal (RIP, GM).
Every imaginable manifestation and toxicity has reared its ugly head during this time. Every imaginable reincarnation of betrayal as well.
This website went 'live' on 17 November 2010, after a conversation with Julian Assange and Sarah Harrison a week earlier, in anticipation of the formal arrest of Assange by Ny's proxy in Stockholm the following day. Those involved anticipated a wave of malicious misinformation, and the site was explicitly created to combat what would inevitably follow. Part of the initial work was carried out by a volunteer ('AD') in Tokyo.
The site went rogue several years later but was successfully rescued. At that point in time, it took eight months to recover the site and clean up the mess left behind, well over 10,000 spam accounts that the rogue team had let in.
Yes, it's a long story, and neither the angels nor the devils are what they'd appear to be. The truth will out, the truth wins out.
More may follow.
Are the Sweden Democrats celebrating the terror attack of Anders Behring Breivik? That's what 'deaconess' Anna Ardin claimed in a Facebook post on the anniversary of the atrocity. Ardin later removed her post.

We've been so busy sifting through the ashes that too few of us have noticed what's been staring us in the face all along.

Let's change that.
On Friday 26 April of this year, Senior District Court Judge Robert E Payne appended the following to a ruling in the matter of Fitzgibbon v. Radack.

Neither contrition nor emotional distress nor illness nor financial difficulties can excuse deliberate misconduct of this sort by any litigant, much less by a lawyer. And, the record here shows that Radack is a sharp-tongued, mean-spirited, proliferous user of social media. Her conduct here is just more of the same. Neither contrition nor emotional distress nor illness nor financial distress have caused Radack to ameliorate her penchant for nasty social media communication.
The 'Radack' that Judge Payne is referring to is of course the well-known whistleblower attorney Jesselyn Radack.
The myth that became Russiagate was seven years in the making.


Julian Assange today launched a case accusing the government of Ecuador of violating his fundamental rights and freedoms. WikiLeaks general counsel Baltasar GarzÃ³n arrived in Ecuador yesterday to launch the case against the government. The move comes almost seven months after Ecuador threatened to remove his protection and summarily cut off his access to the outside world, including by refusing to allow journalists and human rights organisations to see him, and installing three signal jammers in the embassy to prevent his phone calls and internet access.
Electronic jammers have been placed inside the Ecuador embassy in London to prevent Julian Assange having access to social media, according to news.com.au and RT.com.

Risk, the most recent documentary from Oscar-winner Laura Poitras, premiered a year ago at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was met with standing ovations. Immediately the final credits rolled, Laura, Sarah Harrison, and Jake Appelbaum took to the stage to read an official statement and answer questions.

After almost seven years, Marianne Ny has finally closed the preliminary investigation on Julian Assange, an investigation that should never have been reopened in the first place, after it was closed back in 2010 by an experienced prosecutor.1
The reason for my claim is very elementary: there is no evidence, and then one should not carry on an investigation.2

Marianne Ny's office today reported that they have received, from the Republic of Ecuador, the written report of their interview with Julian Assange from November last year. The report, in the Spanish language, shall now be translated into a language more suitable for Marianne Ny.
Reprinted from Rixstep.
So Julian Assange finally got to submit his statement to the elusive Marianne Ny. Things rolled pretty fast there for a while - it took only 74 months. But now it's been done.
30 November 2016: Today, the United Nations rejected the United Kingdomâs attempt to appeal the UNâs February ruling in favour of Julian Assange.
The decision of 5 February 2016 therefore stands, and the UK and Sweden are once again required to immediately put an end to Mr Assangeâs arbitrary detention and afford him monetary compensation.
Earlier this year, the United Nations concluded the 16 month long case to which the UK was a party. The UK lost, appealed, and today - lost again. The UN instructed the UK and Sweden to take immediate steps to ensure Mr Assange's liberty, protection, and enjoyment of fundamental human rights. No steps have been taken, jeopardising Mr Assange's life, health and physical integrity, and undermining the UN system of human rights protection.
Despite initially being given two weeks to appeal the 5 February ruling, the United Kingdom waited until after the first appeal period expired, and instead submitted an appeal for review on 24 March, which the United Nations now found inadmissable.
As a member of the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council, the United Kingdom must now respect its commitments.
From the UN press release:
The UN expert group also considered four requests for review of previous opinions, submitted by the Arab Republic of Egypt, the State of Kuwait and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Working Group concluded that the requests did not meet the threshold of a review as enshrined in paragraph 21 of its methods of work, and that they were thus not admissible.
At time of writing, there is no response from the website of Marianne Ny or from the prosecution authority's Twitter account, and no mention whatsoever in Swedish media.

Final arguments in Lauri Love's extradition hearing will be heard at 10am on Monday 25 July at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

The cornea is the outer most portion of your eye, which helps you see clearly and serves as your eye’s defense against infection or injury. Cornea disease refers to a large group of conditions that can negatively impact your cornea’s shape, durability, or integrity and potentially cause vision issues. Wolfe Eye Clinic’s cornea specialists are experts in diagnosing and treating corneal issues such as dry eye syndrome and keratoconus, as well as injuries to the cornea through a variety of measures including corneal transplant surgery, if needed.
Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that damages your eye’s optic nerve. The optic nerve connects your eye to your brain and is involved in helping your brain make sense of what you see. There are many types of glaucoma, most caused by high pressure within the eye. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness. Wolfe Eye Clinic’s glaucoma specialists have expertise in evaluating, managing and treating all types of glaucoma to help you maintain your vision and ocular pressure.
LASIK
LASIK laser eye surgery is a form of refractive surgery that corrects nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. Using advanced 100% all-laser, bladeless technology, Wolfe Eye Clinic LASIK specialists evaluate your eyes and perform surgery to reshape your cornea, offering you the opportunity to see clearly without the need for contacts or glasses. Having performed more LASIK surgeries in the state of Iowa than any other provider, you can be sure you're trusting your eyes to Iowa’s premier LASIK specialists.
Oculofacial Plastics
Oculofacial plastics is the specialized care, treatment and reconstructive surgery of critical structures surrounding the eye such as eyelids or eye sockets. Disease, injury, trauma, tumors and aging can impact your eye’s surrounding structures, interfering with your vision or changing your appearance. Wolfe Eye Clinic’s oculofacial specialists have expertise in evaluating and medically, surgically, or cosmetically treating eye structural issues to help improve your vision or facial appearance.
Pediatric
Our pediatric ophthalmologists specialize in eye disease, visual development and vision care of children as well as adult strabismus. Many eye disorders such as amblyopia or “lazy eye” can begin to develop in childhood and may become apparent through your child’s behavior. Wolfe Eye Clinic pediatric specialists are here to help you as a parent understand your child’s vision issue and with the utmost care, treat your child’s eye issue so that they can continue enjoying their childhood.
Retina Disease
Retina disease encompasses a range of eye conditions that damage your retina such as macular degeneration, retinal detachments or diabetic eye disease. The retina is an important thin layer of tissue along the inside back wall of your eye that helps your brain make sense of what you see. When left untreated, retina disease can lead to vision loss or blindness. Wolfe Eye Clinic retina ophthalmologists not only have specialized training to medically and surgically treat retina diseases but are actively involved in medical research to advance retina treatments for patients.

womenwhocode
A year ago, I was honored to continue my professional career path in a new position with Women Who Code (WWCode) as the first Individual Giving Manager at the female-founded tech nonprofit. It has been 12 months of front-row access to the unique ecosystem comprising the global tech community. What has been clear is the global tech community has an abiding desire to support each other and ultimately support the world as a whole through the practiced talents of engineers. 

As Individual Giving Manager at WWCode, I help connect people, foundations, and companies with the mission, and together, we find the best solution for them to provide support. WWCode is on a mission to empower diverse women to excel in tech careers. The need is there. Despite making up 50% of the population, women only account for a quarter of the tech workforce, the numbers drop further when assessing women in senior positions or leadership. 

80% of women shared that they love their jobs in science, engineering, and technology. Despite this, they are still 45% more likely to leave their job in these industries when compared to their male peers. Many of these women listed barriers such as isolation from the “boys club,” biased performance reviews, and an absence of mentors or sponsors in the workplace as reasons they leave. 

WWCode was created to help retain those women and show them pathways to upscale their careers in tech, with training, mentorship, and community at the core. In fact, 80% of WWCode members reported that WWCode positively impacted their careers. Along the way, WWCode has connected with individuals, foundations, and companies who believe in the mission and support a more diverse tech workforce where women and historically excluded people thrive at every level. 

In December 2022, the Proton community joined the ranks of WWCode supporters. You may be familiar with Proton if you, like millions around the world, desire an email service that puts privacy and security at the forefront. For five years, Proton has hosted the popular Proton Lifetime Account Charity Raffle. Proton offers ten exclusive and highly sought-after Proton Lifetime accounts, which give access to the highest subscription plan for all existing and future Proton products. The 2022 raffle raised a record-breaking $784,670, which was split ten ways for ten deserving charities, including Women Who Code.
Proton CEO, Andy Yen, shared how recipients were chosen. 
Recipients of grants are always nominated by the Proton community, and WWCode was among more than 600 organizations nominated this year. We believe empowering women to enter STEM and become more active in cybersecurity ultimately leads to a better internet. We saw an example of this in Iran, where tech-savvy young women led a protest movement by widely leveraging privacy tools like Proton VPN, which was ultimately downloaded by millions of Iranians. We look forward to working with WWCode to continue to advance the mission that we started when we originally launched Proton Mail back in 2014.

[At Proton], we know that the work to create a better world goes beyond us, and that's why over the years, we have contributed over $2M to non-profit organizations that align with Proton's values and advance privacy, freedom, and equality. In our annual charity fundraiser, we only support organizations that have been carefully vetted to make sure they are effective, efficient, and impactful. Organizations have ranged from the largest independent press organization in Belarus to humanitarian organizations supporting activists in Hong Kong who have been imprisoned, so we are also not constrained by geography.
WWCode wants to thank Proton, and all of our donors from our ten-year history, for their support of our mission and the community of women impacted. 

If you would like to become a WWCode supporter, visit our website to make an online donation, A recurring monthly donation of $27 helps provide WWCode membership for 12 women every year. To learn more, contact Individual Giving Manager Molly Devine at donate@womenwhocode.com. 

A note about Proton from the CEO, Andy Yen: 

[At Proton], we believe a better world starts with privacy. This belief guides every decision we make, and it is why we are committed to always providing a free version of Proton Mail encrypted email, along with free versions of all our other privacy services. We believe everyone in the world should have access to a private, secure, and free Internet without discrimination. Our journey began in 2014 when ten thousand people believed in our cause and chose to support the development of our encrypted email service, Proton Mail, through a record-setting crowdfunding campaign. In eight years, the Proton community has grown to millions of people, many of whom have directly contributed to Proton's evolution. In many ways, Proton is built by the community, for the community.

Notwithstanding recent attempts to reconstruct his physiognomy from remains of his skull, no one knows what Dante really looked like.  A death mask exists but there is  no trustworthy historic testimony concerning it.  The two earliest portraits in the gallery, one in the Bargello and the other in the former Palazzo dei giudici e notai are distinctly different from on another.  Neither can be definitively confirmed as a true likeness of Dante.  Medieval and Renaissance portraits were loosely derived from Boccaccio's and Villani's descriptions of the poet,  In his Life of Dante, Boccaccio reports that Dante's face was "long, his nose aquiline, his eyes rather large than small, his jaws heavy, with the under lip projecting beyond the upper.  His complexion was dark, and his hair and beard, black, and crisp; and his countenance always sad and thoughtful."  As this selection of portraits shows, the features which have been most frequently preserved are the poet's aquiline nose, dark hair, and thoughtful countenance.  Through the ages artists have portrayed Dante's physiognomy in a fascinating variety of ways.

Government authorises first COVID-19 vaccine on independent advice of medicines regulator.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said:
The government has today accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve Pfizer/BioNTechâs COVID-19 vaccine for use. This follows months of rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA who have concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.
The Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations (JCVI) will shortly publish its final advice for the priority groups to receive the vaccine, including care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and the clinically extremely vulnerable.
The vaccine will be made available across the UK from next week. The NHS has decades of experience in delivering large-scale vaccination programmes and will begin putting their extensive preparations into action to provide care and support to all those eligible for vaccination.
To aid the success of the vaccination programme it is vital everyone continues to play their part and abide by the necessary restrictions in their area so we can further suppress the virus and allow the NHS to do its work without being overwhelmed.
Further details will be set out shortly.

S-Config A.K.A. "S" is a blogger. Phew! That was easy! Pack it up boys we're done here!
Oh, wait, you want more? Wow, okay.
Welcome to this little slice of the net known as S-Config. Here's hoping that you have a wonderful day wherever you are in the crazed yet delicious world we live in! "S" works with Art and Music/Sounds in the pastime. Existing online within a remote bunker somewhere within Milwaukee, Wisconsin State, United States of America, North American Continent, Terra, and Sol universal region. "S" has interests in the fandoms such as sci-fi, and cyberpunk, and is essentially furry-trash er, and furry subcultures and thus the theming of some writing will have a bias on such topics. You've been warned. Have a QR-CodeÂ (right of this paragraph) if you wish to browse on your phone.
The "Site Maps" section is available to assist with navigation. Also, check the FAQ if you crave more information about how our little world operates.
If you came from a webring or a friend-o? The Cellar Door provides gateways to other websites like ours and is highly recommended!
S-Config acts as a core dump of information in visual form without any malicious nature of spying on you the reader with analytic cookies and/or software. In case you do not believe us and are concerned about your privacy. All we have to say to that is:
Good! The paranoia engine will keep you alive! Don't trust Rando's on the internet! - S
Always check your data to ensure your online privacy!
Never mindlessly accept the truth from others without first checking the data. At the very least you can slam that "F12" key in a modern browser and see what your "Network tab" is doing. No one will save you until you start saving yourself!
This website rejects the notion of server inter-dependency. Instead, S-Config takes back all data created. This methodology (considered dangerous to some) is a centralization model under the blogger's control instead of a corporation and/or a group of 3rd party individuals. Of course, we are underneath a web hosting provider as explained here. However, it can be moved at any time and at the administration's discretion.
S-Config doesn't want Web 1.0 or the "old internet" back. Because when you think about it the internet didn't really change at all. The internet may have gotten more advanced with ad tracking software but at the end of the day, everyone is in a server bin with everyone else. S is not some internet warrior shouting its manifesto to destroy the big bad social networks. But instead to simply exist. Perhaps to encourage others to do the same who the hell knows really? All we can do is minimize the damage and take a lot of the big servers out of the equation. This is why addresses for more private protocols are available. We feel this is the best practice to maintain the privacy of you the reader.
You the reader are not a product! We understand this because at one point in our existence within the net we are all readers and explorers. So, Wear those dusters and hoodies boys, girls, and robots all around the multiverse; You will find no heroes wearing capes here.
Most important of all:
May server protect you.

Ever since 1996, the Yes Men have used humor and trickery to highlight the corporate takeover of society, the neoliberal delusion that allows it,Â the corporate Democrats' responsibility for our current situation, and so on.

                              There are a few ways to get started on YouTube. We
                              offer up different formats and functionalities,
                              giving you the flexibility to create everything
                              from Shorts, which are vertical videos that run 60
                              seconds or less, to longer form videos.
                            

                              No matter what youâre creating, youâll need to
                              start by creating a YouTube Channel.
                            
Next, youâll want to upload your videos!

                              Growing your channel is all about creating videos
                              viewers want to watch and accurately presenting
                              them to the audience. When doing so, hereâs a few
                              tips to keep in mind.
                            

                              With each video, think carefully about the title,
                              description, and
                              thumbnail
                              you plan to use - these should all accurately
                              reflect your content and let viewers know what
                              they can expect from the video. If youâre a Shorts
                              creator, think about how the first 1-2 seconds of
                              your content can grab viewers scrolling through
                              the video feed!
                            

                              Once youâve got viewers watching, you can redirect
                              their attention via hashtags,
                              playlists,
                              cards,
                              end screens, and more.
                            

                              YouTube Studio is your home base for posting
                              videos and making edits to your channel. To update
                              your channelâs basic info like name,
                              profile picture, and banner, just log in and tap âCustomisationâ
                              to see your options.
                            

                              You can also make changes to your channel using
                              the Studio Mobile app. You can tap âYour Channelâ
                              and then âEdit Channelâ to update and edit how
                              your channel looks to your viewers. Note that you
                              can only change your channelâs name three times
                              every 90 days.

                              Promoting your videos is all about getting the
                              word out there. On YouTube, you can use tools like
                              cards, end screens, Stories, and Community Posts
                              to drive viewers to a specific piece of content!
                            

                              Off-platform, think about promoting your videos on
                              your socials and relevant communities, podcasts,
                              or platforms that align with your content and your
                              intended audience.

                              Our search and discovery systems are built to find
                              videos that match viewersâ individual interests.
                              We
                              recommend videos
                              based on things such as: what your audience
                              watches and doesnât watch, how much time they
                              spend watching, what they like and dislike, if
                              they mark a video as ânot interestedâ, and on
                              satisfaction surveys.
                            

                              So, rather than trying trying to find a secret
                              code to these systems, focus instead on making
                              videos that you think will resonate with your
                              audience. A great tool here is YouTube Analytics,
                              which provides data that can help you understand
                              how your existing content is performing and
                              provide insights for future videos!
